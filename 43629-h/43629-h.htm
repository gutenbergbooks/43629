<h2><a id="intro">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Personal.</span></h3><p class="p_inline">&mdash;The public has, perhaps, a right
to be made acquainted with the title under which
I, an unknown writer, come forward as the translator
of a difficult Chinese work. In the spring of
1867 I began the study of Chinese at <abbr title="Her Britannic Majesty's">H.B.M.’s</abbr>
Legation, Peking, under an implied promise, in a
despatch from the then Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs, that successful efforts would be
rewarded by proportionately rapid advancement
in the service of which I was a member. Then
followed a long novitiate of utterly uninteresting
and, indeed, most repellent labour,&mdash;inseparable,
however, from the acquisition of this language,
which throughout its early stages demands more
from sheer memory than from the exercise of any
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xiv"><a id="Page_i-xiv"></a></span>
other intellectual faculty. At length, in the spring
of 1877, while acting as Vice-Consul at Canton, I
commenced the translation of the work here
offered to the English reader. For such a task
I had flattered myself into the belief that I
possessed two of the requisite qualifications: an
accurate knowledge of the grammatical structure
of the language, and an extensive insight into the
manners, customs, superstitions, and general social
life of the Chinese. I had been variously stationed
at Peking, Tientsin, Takow, and Taiwan Fu (in
Formosa), Ningpo, Hankow, Swatow, and Canton,
from the latter of which I was transferred&mdash;when
my task was still only half finished&mdash;to Amoy. I
had travelled beyond the Great Wall into Mongolia;
and I had made the journey overland from
Swatow to Canton, a distance of five hundred
miles; besides which, in addition to my study of
the language, my daily object in life had always
been to familiarise myself as much as possible
with Chinese sympathies and habits of thought.
With these advantages, and by the interesting
nature of the subject-matter, I hoped to be able
on the one hand to arouse a somewhat deeper
interest than is usually taken in the affairs of
China; and, on the other, to correct at any rate
some of the erroneous views, too frequently palmed
off by inefficient and disingenuous workers, and
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xv"><a id="Page_i-xv"></a></span>
too readily accepted as fact. And I would here
draw attention to one most important point;
namely, that although a great number of books
have been published about China and the Chinese,
there are extremely few in which the information
is conveyed at first hand; in other words, in which
the Chinese are allowed to speak for themselves.<a id="Anchor-1" title="Go to Footnote 1" href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Hence, perhaps, it may be that in an accurately-compiled
work such as Tylor’s <cite>Primitive Culture</cite>,
allusions to the religious rites and ceremonies of
nearly one-third of the human race are condensed
within the limits of barely a dozen short passages.
Hence, too, it undoubtedly is that many Chinese
customs are ridiculed and condemned by turns,
simply because the medium through which they
have been conveyed has produced a distorted
image. Much of what the Chinese do actually
believe and practise in their religious and social
life will be found in this volume, in the <i xml:lang="la">ipsissima
verba</i> of a highly-educated scholar writing about
his fellow-countrymen and his native land; while
for the notes with which I have essayed to make
the picture more suggestive and more acceptable
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xvi"><a id="Page_i-xvi"></a></span>
to the European eye, I claim only so much authority
as is due to the opinion of one qualified
observer who can have no possible motive in
deviating ever so slightly from what his own personal
experience has taught him to regard as the
truth.</p>
</div>


<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Biographical.</span></h3><p class="p_inline">&mdash;The barest skeleton of a
biography is all that can be formed from the very
scanty materials which remain to mark the career
of a writer whose work has been for the best part
of two centuries as familiar throughout the length
and breadth of China as are the tales of the
“Arabian Nights” in all English-speaking communities.
The author of “Strange Stories” was a
native of Tzu-chou, in the province of Shan-tung.
His family name was P‘u; his particular name
was Sung-ling; and the designation or literary
epithet by which, in accordance with Chinese
usage, he was commonly known among his friends,
was Liu-hsien, or “Last of the Immortals.” A
further fancy name, given to him probably by
some enthusiastic admirer, was Liu Ch‘üan, or
“Willow Spring;” but he is now familiarly spoken
of simply as P‘u Sung-ling. We are unacquainted
with the years of his birth or death; however, by
the aid of a meagre entry in the <cite>History of Tzü-chou</cite>
it is possible to make a pretty good guess at
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xvii"><a id="Page_i-xvii"></a></span>
the date of the former event. For we are there
told that P‘u Sung-ling successfully competed for
the lowest or bachelor’s degree before he had
reached the age of twenty; and that in 1651 he
was in the position of a graduate of ten years’
standing, having failed in the interim to take the
second, or master’s, degree. To this failure, due, as
we are informed in the history above quoted, to his
neglect of the beaten track of academic study, we
owe the existence of his great work; not, indeed,
his only production, though the one <i xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>
by which, as Confucius said of his own “Spring
and Autumn,” men will know him. All else that
we have on record of P‘u Sung-ling, besides the
fact that he lived in close companionship with
several eminent scholars of the day, is gathered
from his own words, written when, in 1679, he laid
down his pen upon the completion of a task
which was to raise him within a short period to
a foremost rank in the Chinese world of letters.
Of that record I here append a close translation,
accompanied by such notes as are absolutely
necessary to make it intelligible to non-students
of Chinese.</p>

devils and serpent Gods,<a id="Anchor-5" title="Go to Footnote 5" href="#Footnote-5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> he of the long-nails<a id="Anchor-6" title="Go to Footnote 6" href="#Footnote-6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> never
wearied to tell. Each interprets in his own way the music
of heaven;<a id="Anchor-7" title="Go to Footnote 7" href="#Footnote-7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and whether it be discord or not, depends
upon antecedent causes.<a id="Anchor-8" title="Go to Footnote 8" href="#Footnote-8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> As for me, I cannot, with my
poor autumn fire-fly’s light, match myself against the
hobgoblins of the age.<a id="Anchor-9" title="Go to Footnote 9" href="#Footnote-9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> I am but the dust in the sunbeam,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xix"><a id="Page_i-xix"></a></span>
a fit laughing-stock for devils.<a id="Anchor-10" title="Go to Footnote 10" href="#Footnote-10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> For my talents
are not those of Yü Pao,<a id="Anchor-11" title="Go to Footnote 11" href="#Footnote-11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> elegant explorer of the records
of the Gods; I am rather animated by the Spirit of Su
Tung-p‘o,<a id="Anchor-12" title="Go to Footnote 12" href="#Footnote-12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> who loved to hear men speak of the supernatural.
I get people to commit what they tell me to
writing, and subsequently I dress it up in the form of
a story; and thus in the lapse of time my friends from
all quarters have supplied me with quantities of material,
which, from my habit of collecting, has grown into a
vast pile.<a id="Anchor-13" title="Go to Footnote 13" href="#Footnote-13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>“Human beings, I would point out, are not beyond
the pale of fixed laws, and yet there are more remarkable
phenomena in their midst than in the country of those
who crop their hair;<a id="Anchor-14" title="Go to Footnote 14" href="#Footnote-14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> antiquity is unrolled before us, and
many tales are to be found therein stranger than that of
the nation of Flying Heads.<a id="Anchor-15" title="Go to Footnote 15" href="#Footnote-15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> ‘Irrepressible bursts, and
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xx"><a id="Page_i-xx"></a></span>
luxurious ease,’<a id="Anchor-16" title="Go to Footnote 16" href="#Footnote-16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>&mdash;such was always his enthusiastic strain.
‘For ever indulging in liberal thought,’<a id="Anchor-17" title="Go to Footnote 17" href="#Footnote-17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;thus he spoke
openly without restraint. Were men like these to open
my book, I should be a laughing-stock to them indeed.
At the cross-roads<a id="Anchor-18" title="Go to Footnote 18" href="#Footnote-18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> men will not listen to me, and yet I
have some knowledge of the three states of existence<a id="Anchor-19" title="Go to Footnote 19" href="#Footnote-19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
spoken of beneath the cliff;<a id="Anchor-20" title="Go to Footnote 20" href="#Footnote-20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> neither should the words
I utter be set aside because of him that utters them.<a id="Anchor-21" title="Go to Footnote 21" href="#Footnote-21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
When the bow<a id="Anchor-22" title="Go to Footnote 22" href="#Footnote-22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> was hung at my father’s door, he dreamed
that a sickly-looking Buddhist priest, but half-covered
by his stole, entered the chamber. On one of his breasts
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xxi"><a id="Page_i-xxi"></a></span>
was a round piece of plaster like a <i>cash;</i><a id="Anchor-23" title="Go to Footnote 23" href="#Footnote-23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and my father,
waking from sleep, found that I, just born, had a similar
black patch on my body. As a child, I was thin and
constantly ailing, and unable to hold my own in the
battle of life. Our home was chill and desolate as a
monastery; and working there for my livelihood with
my pen,<a id="Anchor-24" title="Go to Footnote 24" href="#Footnote-24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> I was as poor as a priest with his alms-bowl.<a id="Anchor-25" title="Go to Footnote 25" href="#Footnote-25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Often and often I put my hand to my head<a id="Anchor-26" title="Go to Footnote 26" href="#Footnote-26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and exclaimed,
‘Surely he who sat with his face to the wall<a id="Anchor-27" title="Go to Footnote 27" href="#Footnote-27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
was myself in a previous state of existence;’ and thus
I referred my non-success in this life to the influence
of a destiny surviving from the last. I have been tossed
hither and thither in the direction of the ruling wind,
like a flower falling in filthy places; but the six paths<a id="Anchor-28" title="Go to Footnote 28" href="#Footnote-28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
of transmigration are inscrutable indeed, and I have no
right to complain. As it is, midnight finds me with an
expiring lamp, while the wind whistles mournfully without;
and over my cheerless table I piece together my
tales,<a id="Anchor-29" title="Go to Footnote 29" href="#Footnote-29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> vainly hoping to produce a sequel to the <cite>Infernal
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xxii"><a id="Page_i-xxii"></a></span>
Regions</cite>.<a id="Anchor-30" title="Go to Footnote 30" href="#Footnote-30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> With a bumper I stimulate my pen, yet I
only succeed thereby in ‘venting my excited feelings,’<a id="Anchor-31" title="Go to Footnote 31" href="#Footnote-31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
and as I thus commit my thoughts to writing, truly I am
an object worthy of commiseration. Alas! I am but
the bird that, dreading the winter frost, finds no shelter
in the tree: the autumn insect that chirps to the moon,
and hugs the door for warmth. For where are they who
know me?<a id="Anchor-32" title="Go to Footnote 32" href="#Footnote-32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> They are ‘in the bosky grove, and at the
frontier pass’<a id="Anchor-33" title="Go to Footnote 33" href="#Footnote-33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>&mdash;wrapped in an impenetrable gloom!”</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>From the above curious document the reader
will gain some insight into the abstruse, but at the
same time marvellously beautiful, style of this
gifted writer. The whole essay&mdash;for such it is,
and among the most perfect of its kind&mdash;is intended
chiefly as a satire upon the scholarship of
the age; scholarship which had turned the author
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xxiii"><a id="Page_i-xxiii"></a></span>
back to the disappointment of a private life, himself
conscious all the time of the inward fire that
had been lent him by heaven. It is the key-note
to his own subsequent career, spent in the retirement
of home, in the society of books and friends;
as also to the numerous uncomplimentary allusions
which occur in all his stories relating to official
life. Whether or not the world at large has been
a gainer by this instance of the fallibility of competitive
examinations has been already decided in
the affirmative by the millions of P‘u Sung-ling’s
own countrymen, who for the past two hundred
years have more than made up to him by a posthumous
and enduring reverence for the loss of
those earthly and ephemeral honours which he
seems to have coveted so much.</p>


<div class="justify">
<h3 class="inline"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Bibliographical.</span></h3><p class="p_inline">&mdash;<cite>Strange Stories from
a Chinese Studio</cite>, known to the Chinese as the
<cite>Liao-Chai-Chih-I</cite>, or more familiarly, the <cite>Liao-Chai</cite>,
has hardly been mentioned by a single
foreigner without some inaccuracy on the part of
the writer concerned. For instance, the late Mr.
Mayers states in his <cite>Chinese Reader’s Manual</cite>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 176, that this work was composed “circa <span class="smallfont2">A.D.</span>
1710,” the fact being that the collection was
actually completed in 1679, as we know by
the date attached to the “Author’s Own Record”
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xxiv"><a id="Page_i-xxiv"></a></span>
given above. It is consequently two
centuries, almost to the day, since the first
appearance of a book destined to a popularity
which the lapse of time seems wholly unable
to diminish; and the present may fairly be considered
a fitting epoch for its first presentation
to the English reader in an English dress. I
should mention, however, that the <cite>Liao-Chai</cite> was
originally, and for many years, circulated in manuscript
only. P‘u Sung-ling, as we are told in a
colophon by his grandson to the first edition, was
too poor to meet the heavy expense of block-cutting;
and it was not until as late as 1740, when
the author must have been already for some time
a denizen of the dark land he so much loved to
describe, that his aforesaid grandson printed and
published the collection now so universally famous.
Since then many editions have been laid before
the Chinese public, the best of which is that by
Tan Ming-lun, a Salt Commissioner, who flourished
during the reign of Tao Kuang, and who in 1842
produced, at his own expense, an excellent edition
in sixteen small octavo volumes of about 160 pages
each. And as various editions will occasionally be
found to contain various readings, I would here
warn students of Chinese who wish to compare my
rendering with the text, that it is from the edition
of Tan Ming-lun, collated with that of Yü Chi,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xxv"><a id="Page_i-xxv"></a></span>
published in 1766, that this translation has been
made. Many have been the commentaries and
disquisitions upon the meaning of obscure passages
and the general scope of this work; to say nothing
of the prefaces with which the several editions have
been ushered into the world. Of the latter, I have
selected one specimen, from which the reader will
be able to form a tolerably accurate opinion as to
the true nature of these always singular and usually
difficult compositions. Here it <span class="nowrap">is:&mdash;</span></p>

<div>
<h4>T‘ANG MÊNG LAI’S PREFACE.</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>“The common saying, ‘He regards a camel as a horse
with a swelled back,’ trivial of itself, may be used in
illustration of greater matters. Men are wont to attribute
an existence only to such things as they daily see with
their own eyes, and they marvel at whatsoever, appearing
before them at one instant, vanishes at the next. And
yet it is not at the sprouting and falling of foliage, or at
the metamorphosis of insects that they marvel, but only
at the manifestations of the supernatural world; though
of a truth, the whistling of the wind and the movement
of streams, with nothing to set the one in motion or give
sound to the other, might well be ranked among extraordinary
phenomena. We are accustomed to these, and
therefore do not note them. We marvel at devils and
foxes: we do not marvel at man. But who is it that
causes a man to move and to speak?&mdash;to which question
comes the ready answer of each individual so questioned,
‘<em>I</em> do.’ This ‘I do,’ however, is merely a personal consciousness
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xxvi"><a id="Page_i-xxvi"></a></span>
of the facts under discussion. For a man can
see with his eyes, but he cannot see what it is that makes
him see; he can hear with his ears, but he cannot hear
what it is that makes him hear; how, then, is it possible
for him to understand the rationale of things he can
neither see nor hear. Whatever has come within the
bounds of their own ocular or auricular experience men
regard as proved to be actually existing; and only such
things.<a id="Anchor-34" title="Go to Footnote 34" href="#Footnote-34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> But this term ‘experience’ may be understood
in various senses. For instance, people speak of something
which has certain attributes as <em>form</em>, and of something
else which has certain other attributes as <em>substance;</em>
ignorant as they are that form and substance are to be
found existing without those particular attributes. Things
which are thus constituted are inappreciable, indeed, by
our ears and eyes; but we cannot argue that therefore
they do not exist. Some persons can see a mosquito’s
eye, while to others even a mountain is invisible; some
can hear the sound of ants battling together, while others
again fail to catch the roar of a thunder-peal. Powers
of seeing and hearing vary; there should be no reckless
imputations of blindness. According to the schoolmen,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xxvii"><a id="Page_i-xxvii"></a></span>
man at his death is dispersed like wind or fire, the origin
and end of his vitality being alike unknown; and as
those who have seen strange phenomena are few, the
number of those who marvel at them is proportionately
great, and the ‘horse with a swelled back’ parallel is very
widely applicable. And ever quoting the fact that Confucius
would have nothing to say on these topics, these
schoolmen half discredit such works as the <cite>Ch‘i-chieh-chih-kuai</cite>
and the <cite>Yü-ch‘u-chi-i</cite>,<a id="Anchor-35" title="Go to Footnote 35" href="#Footnote-35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> ignorant that the Sage’s
unwillingness to speak had reference only to persons of
an inferior mental calibre; for his own <cite>Spring and
Autumn</cite> can hardly be said to be devoid of all allusions
of the kind. Now P‘u Liu-hsien devoted himself in his
youth to the marvellous, and as he grew older was
specially remarkable for his comprehension thereof; and
being moreover a most elegant writer, he occupied his
leisure in recording whatever came to his knowledge of a
particularly marvellous nature. A volume of these
compositions of his formerly fell into my hands, and
was constantly borrowed by friends; now, I have another
volume, and of what I read only about three-tenths was
known to me before. What there is, should be sufficient
to open the eyes of those schoolmen, though I
much fear it will be like talking of ice to a butterfly.
Personally, I disbelieve in the irregularity of natural
phenomena, and regard as evil spirits only those who
injure their neighbours. For eclipses, falling stars, the
flight of herons, the nest of a mina, talking stones, and
the combats of dragons, can hardly be classed as
irregular; while the phenomena of nature occurring
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xxviii"><a id="Page_i-xxviii"></a></span>
out of season, wars, rebellions, and so forth, may
certainly be relegated to the category of evil. In my
opinion the morality of P‘u Liu-hsien’s work is of a very
high standard, its object being distinctly to glorify
virtue and to censure vice, and as a book calculated to
elevate mankind may be safely placed side by side with
the philosophical treatises of Yang Hsiung which Huan
Tan declared to be so worthy of a wide circulation.”</p>

<div>
<p>With regard to the meaning of the Chinese
words <i>Liao-Chai-Chih-I</i>, this title has received
indifferent treatment at the hands of different
writers. Dr. Williams chose to render it by “Pastimes
of the Study,” and Mr. Mayers by “The
Record of Marvels, or Tales of the Genii;” neither
of which is sufficiently near to be regarded in the
light of a translation. Taken literally and in
order, these words stand for “Liao&mdash;library&mdash;record&mdash;strange,”
“Liao” being simply a fanciful name
given by our author to his private library or studio.
An apocryphal anecdote traces the origin of this
selection to a remark once made by himself with
reference to his failure for the second degree.
“Alas!” he is reported to have said, “I shall now
have no resource (<i>Liao</i>) for my old age;” and
accordingly he so named his study, meaning that
in his pen he would seek that resource which fate
had denied to him as an official. For this untranslatable
“Liao” I have ventured to substitute
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xxix"><a id="Page_i-xxix"></a></span>
“Chinese,” as indicating more clearly the nature of
what is to follow. No such title as “Tales of the
Genii” fully expresses the scope of this work,
which embraces alike weird stories of Taoist
devilry and magic, marvellous accounts of impossible
countries beyond the sea, simple scenes of
Chinese every-day life, and notices of extraordinary
natural phenomena. Indeed, the author once had
it in contemplation to publish only the more
imaginative of the tales in the present collection
under the title of “Devil and Fox Stories;” but
from this scheme he was ultimately dissuaded by
his friends, the result being the heterogeneous mass
which is more aptly described by the title I have
given to this volume. In a similar manner, I too
had originally determined to publish a full and
complete translation of the whole of these sixteen
volumes; but on a closer acquaintance many
of the stories turned out to be quite unsuitable for
the age in which we live, forcibly recalling the
coarseness of our own writers of fiction in the last
century. Others again were utterly pointless, or
mere repetitions in a slightly altered form. Of
the whole, I therefore selected one hundred and
sixty-four of the best and most characteristic
stories, of which eight had previously been published
by Mr. Allen in the <cite>China Review</cite>, one by
Mr. Mayers in <cite>Notes and Queries on China and
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xxx"><a id="Page_i-xxx"></a></span>
Japan</cite>, two by myself in the columns of the
<cite>Celestial Empire</cite>, and four by Dr. Williams in a
now forgotten handbook of Chinese. The remaining
one hundred and forty-nine have never before,
to my knowledge, been translated into English.
To those, however, who can enjoy the <cite>Liao-Chai</cite> in
the original text, the distinctions between the
various stories of felicity in plot, originality, and
so on, are far less sharply defined, so impressed as
each competent reader must be by the incomparable
style in which even the meanest is arrayed.
For in this respect, as important now in Chinese
eyes as it was with ourselves in days not long gone
by, the author of the <cite>Liao-Chai</cite> and the rejected
candidate succeeded in founding a school of his
own, in which he has since been followed by hosts
of servile imitators with more or less success.
Terseness is pushed to its extreme limits; each
particle that can be safely dispensed with is scrupulously
eliminated; and every here and there
some new and original combination invests perhaps
a single word with a force it could never have
possessed except under the hands of a perfect
master of his art. Add to the above, copious
allusions and adaptations from a course of reading
which would seem to have been co-extensive with
the whole range of Chinese literature, a wealth
of metaphor and an artistic use of figures generally
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xxxi"><a id="Page_i-xxxi"></a></span>
to which only the <i xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvres</i> of Carlyle form an
adequate parallel; and the result is a work which
for purity and beauty of style is now universally
accepted in China as the best and most perfect
model. Sometimes the story runs along plainly
and smoothly enough; but the next moment we
may be plunged into pages of abstruse text, the
meaning of which is so involved in quotations from
and allusions to the poetry or history of the past
three thousand years as to be recoverable only
after diligent perusal of the commentary and much
searching in other works of reference. In illustration
of the popularity of this book, Mr. Mayers
once stated that “the porter at his gate, the boatman
at his mid-day rest, the chair-coolie at his
stand, no less than the man of letters among his
books, may be seen poring with delight over the
elegantly-narrated marvels of the <cite>Liao-Chai;</cite>” but
he would doubtless have withdrawn this judgment
in later years, with the work lying open before
him. Ever since I have been in China, I have
made a point of never, when feasible, passing by a
reading Chinaman without asking permission to
glance at the volume in his hand; and at my
various stations in China I have always kept up a
borrowing acquaintance with the libraries of my
private or official servants; but I can safely affirm
that I have not once detected the <cite>Liao-Chai</cite> in the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-xxxii"><a id="Page_i-xxxii"></a></span>
hands of an ill-educated man. Mr. Mayers made,
perhaps, a happier hit when he observed that
“fairy-tales told in the style of the <cite>Anatomy of
Melancholy</cite> would scarcely be a popular book in
Great Britain;” though except in some particular
points of contact, the styles of these two writers
could scarcely claim even the most distant of relationships.</p>
</div>

<p>Such, then, is the setting of this collection of
<cite>Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio</cite>, many of
which contain, in addition to the advantages of
style and plot, a very excellent moral. The
intention of most of them is, in the actual words
of T‘ang Mêng-lai, “to glorify virtue and to censure
vice,”&mdash;always, it must be borne in mind,
according to the Chinese and not to a European
interpretation of these terms. As an addition to our
knowledge of the folk-lore of China, and as an
<i xml:lang="fr">aperçu</i> of the manners, customs, and social life of
that vast Empire, my translation of the <cite>Liao-Chai</cite>
may not be wholly devoid of interest. The amusement
and instruction I have myself derived from
the task thus voluntarily imposed has already
more than repaid me for the pains I have been at
to put this work before the English public in a
pleasing and available form.</p>

<br/>
EXAMINATION FOR THE POST OF
GUARDIAN ANGEL.</a><a id="Anchor-36" title="Go to Footnote 36" href="#Footnote-36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">My</span> eldest sister’s husband’s grandfather, named Sung
Tao, was a graduate.<a id="Anchor-37" title="Go to Footnote 37" href="#Footnote-37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> One day, while lying down from
indisposition, an official messenger arrived, bringing the
usual notification in his hand and leading a horse with
a white forehead, to summon him to the examination for
his master’s degree. Mr. Sung here remarked that
the Grand Examiner had not yet come, and asked
why there should be this hurry. The messenger did
not reply to this, but pressed so earnestly that at length
Mr. Sung roused himself, and getting upon the horse
<span class="pagenum" title="i-2"><a id="Page_i-2"></a></span>
rode with him. The way seemed strange, and by-and-by
they reached a city which resembled the capital
of a prince. They then entered the Prefect’s <i>yamên</i>,<a id="Anchor-38" title="Go to Footnote 38" href="#Footnote-38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
the apartments of which were beautifully decorated;
and there they found some ten officials sitting at the
upper end, all strangers to Mr. Sung, with the exception
of one whom he recognised to be the God of War.<a id="Anchor-39" title="Go to Footnote 39" href="#Footnote-39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
In the verandah were two tables and two stools, and
at the end of one of the former a candidate was already
seated, so Mr. Sung sat down alongside of him. On
the table were writing materials for each, and suddenly
down flew a piece of paper with a theme on it, consisting
of the following eight words:&mdash;“One man, two men;
by intention, without intention.” When Mr. Sung had
finished his essay, he took it into the hall. It contained
the following passage: “Those who are virtuous by
intention, though virtuous, shall not be rewarded.
Those who are wicked without intention, though wicked,
shall receive no punishment.” The presiding deities
praised this sentiment very much, and calling Mr. Sung to
come forward, said to him, “A Guardian Angel is wanted
in Honan. Go you and take up the appointment.” Mr.
Sung no sooner heard this than he bowed his head and
wept, saying, “Unworthy though I am of the honour
<span class="pagenum" title="i-3"><a id="Page_i-3"></a></span>
you have conferred upon me, I should not venture to
decline it but that my aged mother has reached her
seventh decade, and there is no one now to take care
of her. I pray you let me wait until she has fulfilled
her destiny, when I will hold myself at your disposal.”
Thereupon one of the deities, who seemed to be the
chief, gave instructions to search out his mother’s term
of life, and a long-bearded attendant forthwith brought
in the Book of Fate. On turning it over, he declared
that she still had nine years to live; and then a consultation
was held among the deities, in the middle of
which the God of War said, “Very well. Let Mr.
graduate Chang take the post, and be relieved in nine
years’ time.” Then, turning to Mr. Sung, he continued,
“You ought to proceed without delay to your post; but
as a reward for your filial piety, you are granted a furlough
of nine years. At the expiration of that time you
will receive another summons.” He next addressed
a few kind words to Mr. Chang; and the two candidates,
having made their <i>kotow</i>, went away together. Grasping
Mr. Sung’s hand, his companion, who gave “Chang Ch‘i
of Ch‘ang-shan” as his name and address, accompanied
him beyond the city walls and gave him a stanza of
poetry at parting. I cannot recollect it all, but in it
occurred this <span class="nowrap">couplet:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse_i-0-5">“With wine and flowers we chase the hours,</div>
  <div class="verse_i4"><span class="legacy-indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In one eternal spring:</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">No moon, no light, to cheer the night&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse_i4"><span class="legacy-indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thyself that ray must bring.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Mr. Sung here left him and rode on, and before very
<span class="pagenum" title="i-4"><a id="Page_i-4"></a></span>
long reached his own home; here he awaked as if from
a dream, and found that he had been dead three
days,<a id="Anchor-40" title="Go to Footnote 40" href="#Footnote-40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> when his mother, hearing a groan in the coffin,
ran to it and helped him out. It was some time before
he could speak, and then he at once inquired about
Ch‘ang-shan, where, as it turned out, a graduate named
Chang had died that very day.</p>

<p>Nine years afterwards, Mr. Sung’s mother, in accordance
with fate, passed from this life; and when the funeral
obsequies were over, her son, having first purified himself,
entered into his chamber and died also. Now his wife’s
family lived within the city, near the western gate; and
all of a sudden they beheld Mr. Sung, accompanied by
numerous chariots and horses with carved trappings and
red-tasselled bits, enter into the hall, make an obeisance,
and depart. They were very much disconcerted at this,
not knowing that he had become a spirit, and rushed
out into the village to make inquiries, when they heard
he was already dead. Mr. Sung had an account of his
adventure written by himself; but unfortunately after
the insurrection it was not to be found. This is only an
outline of the story.</p>

<h2><a id="chapter-2"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
<br/>
THE TALKING PUPILS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Ch‘ang-ngan there lived a scholar, named Fang
Tung, who though by no means destitute of ability was
a very unprincipled rake, and in the habit of following
and speaking to any woman he might chance to meet.
The day before the spring festival of Clear Weather,<a id="Anchor-41" title="Go to Footnote 41" href="#Footnote-41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
he was strolling about outside the city when he saw a
small carriage with red curtains and an embroidered
awning, followed by a crowd of waiting-maids on horseback,
one of whom was exceedingly pretty, and riding
on a small palfrey. Going closer to get a better view,
Mr. Fang noticed that the carriage curtain was partly
open, and inside he beheld a beautifully dressed girl of
about sixteen, lovely beyond anything he had ever seen.
Dazzled by the sight, he could not take his eyes off her;
and, now before, now behind, he followed the carriage
for many a mile. By-and-by he heard the young lady
call out to her maid, and, when the latter came alongside,
say to her, “Let down the screen for me. Who is this
<span class="pagenum" title="i-6"><a id="Page_i-6"></a></span>
rude fellow that keeps on staring so?” The maid
accordingly let down the screen, and looking angrily
at Mr. Fang, said to him, “This is the bride of the
Seventh Prince in the City of Immortals going home
to see her parents, and no village girl that you should
stare at her thus.” Then taking a handful of dust, she
threw it at him and blinded him. He rubbed his eyes
and looked round, but the carriage and horses were
gone. This frightened him, and he went off home, feeling
very uncomfortable about the eyes. He sent for a
doctor to examine his eyes, and on the pupils was found
a small film, which had increased by next morning, the
eyes watering incessantly all the time. The film went
on growing, and in a few days was as thick as a cash.<a id="Anchor-42" title="Go to Footnote 42" href="#Footnote-42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
On the right pupil there came a kind of spiral, and as no
medicine was of any avail, the sufferer gave himself up to
grief and wished for death. He then bethought himself
of repenting of his misdeeds, and hearing that the
<i>Kuang-ming</i> sutra could relieve misery, he got a copy
and hired a man to teach it to him. At first it was very
tedious work, but by degrees he became more composed,
and spent every evening in a posture of devotion, telling
his beads. At the end of a year he had arrived at
a state of perfect calm, when one day he heard a small
voice, about as loud as a fly’s, calling out from his left
<span class="pagenum" title="i-7"><a id="Page_i-7"></a></span>
eye:&mdash;“It’s horridly dark in here.” To this he heard a
reply from the right eye, saying, “Let us go out for
a stroll, and cheer ourselves up a bit.” Then he felt
a wriggling in his nose which made it itch, just as
if something was going out of each of the nostrils; and
after a while he felt it again as if going the other way.
Afterwards he heard a voice from one eye say, “I hadn’t
seen the garden for a long time: the epidendrums are
all withered and dead.” Now Mr. Fang was very fond
of these epidendrums, of which he had planted a great
number, and had been accustomed to water them
himself; but since the loss of his sight he had never
even alluded to them. Hearing, however, these words,
he at once asked his wife why she had let the epidendrums
die. She inquired how he knew they were dead,
and when he told her she went out to see, and found
them actually withered away. They were both very
much astonished at this, and his wife proceeded to
conceal herself in the room. She then observed two
tiny people, no bigger than a bean, come down from her
husband’s nose and run out of the door, where she lost
sight of them. In a little while they came back and
flew up to his face, like bees or beetles seeking their
nests. This went on for some days, until Mr. Fang heard
from the left eye, “This roundabout road is not at all
convenient. It would be as well for us to make a door.”
To this the right eye answered, “My wall is too thick;
it wouldn’t be at all an easy job.” “I’ll try and open
mine,” said the left eye, “and then it will do for both of
us.” Whereupon Mr. Fang felt a pain in his left eye as
<span class="pagenum" title="i-8"><a id="Page_i-8"></a></span>
if something was being split, and in a moment he found
he could see the tables and chairs in the room. He was
delighted at this and told his wife, who examined his eye
and discovered an opening in the film, through which she
could see the black pupil shining out beneath, the
eyeball itself looking like a cracked pepper-corn. By
next morning the film had disappeared, and when his
eye was closely examined it was observed to contain two
pupils. The spiral on the right eye remained as before;
and then they knew that the two pupils had taken up
their abode in one eye. Further, although Mr. Fang
was still blind of one eye, the sight of the other was
better than that of the two together. From this time
he was more careful of his behaviour, and acquired
in his part of the country the reputation of a virtuous
man.<a id="Anchor-43" title="Go to Footnote 43" href="#Footnote-43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<h2><a id="chapter-3"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
<br/>
THE PAINTED WALL.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A Kiang-si</span> gentleman, named Mêng Lung-t‘an, was
lodging at the capital with a Mr. Chu, <abbr title="Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr>, when one
day chance led them to a certain monastery, within
which they found no spacious halls or meditation
chambers, but only an old priest in <i xml:lang="fr">deshabille</i>. On
observing the visitors, he arranged his dress and went
forward to meet them, leading them round and showing
whatever there was to be seen. In the chapel they saw
an image of Chih Kung, and the walls on either side
were beautifully painted with life-like representations of
men and things. On the east side were pictured a
number of fairies, among whom was a young girl whose
maiden tresses were not yet confined by the matron’s
knot. She was picking flowers and gently smiling,
while her cherry lips seemed about to move, and the
moisture of her eyes to overflow. Mr. Chu gazed at
her for a long time without taking his eyes off, until at
last he became unconscious of anything but the thoughts
that were engrossing him. Then, suddenly, he felt
<span class="pagenum" title="i-10"><a id="Page_i-10"></a></span>
himself floating in the air, as if riding on a cloud, and
found himself passing through the wall,<a id="Anchor-44" title="Go to Footnote 44" href="#Footnote-44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> where halls and
pavilions stretched away one after another, unlike the
abodes of mortals. Here an old priest was preaching
the Law of Buddha, surrounded by a large crowd of
listeners. Mr. Chu mingled with the throng, and after
a few moments perceived a gentle tug at his sleeve.
Turning round, he saw the young girl above-mentioned,
who walked laughing away. Mr. Chu at once followed
her, and passing a winding balustrade arrived at a small
apartment beyond which he dared not venture further.
But the young lady, looking back, waved the flowers she
had in her hand as though beckoning him to come on.
He accordingly entered and found nobody else within.
Then they fell on their knees and worshipped heaven
and earth together,<a id="Anchor-45" title="Go to Footnote 45" href="#Footnote-45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and rose up as man and wife, after
which the bride went away, bidding Mr. Chu keep quiet
until she came back. This went on for a couple of
days, when the young lady’s companions began to smell
a rat and discovered Mr. Chu’s hiding-place. Thereupon
they all laughed and said, “My dear, you are now
a married woman, and should leave off that maidenly
<i xml:lang="fr">coiffure</i>.” So they gave her the proper hair-pins and
head ornaments, and bade her go bind her hair, at
which she blushed very much but said nothing. Then
<span class="pagenum" title="i-11"><a id="Page_i-11"></a></span>
one of them cried out, “My sisters, let us be off.
Two’s company, more’s none.” At this they all giggled
again and went away.</p>

<p>Mr. Chu found his wife very much improved by the
alteration in the style of her hair. The high top-knot
and the coronet of pendants were very becoming to her.
But suddenly they heard a sound like the tramping of
heavy-soled boots, accompanied by the clanking of
chains and the noise of angry discussion. The bride
jumped up in a fright, and she and Mr. Chu peeped
out. They saw a man clad in golden armour, with a
face as black as jet, carrying in his hand chains and
whips, and surrounded by all the girls. He asked,
“Are you all here?” “All,” they replied. “If,” said
he, “any mortal is here concealed amongst you, denounce
him at once, and lay not up sorrow for yourselves.”
Here they all answered as before that there
was no one. The man then made a movement as if he
would search the place, upon which the bride was
dreadfully alarmed, and her face turned the colour of
ashes. In her terror she said to Mr. Chu, “Hide
yourself under the bed,” and opening a small lattice in
the wall, disappeared herself. Mr. Chu in his concealment
hardly dared to draw his breath; and in a little while
he heard the boots tramp into the room and out again,
the sound of the voices getting gradually fainter and
fainter in the distance. This reassured him, but he still
heard the voices of people going backwards and forwards
outside; and having been a long time in a
cramped position, his ears began to sing as if there
<span class="pagenum" title="i-12"><a id="Page_i-12"></a></span>
was a locust in them, and his eyes to burn like fire.
It was almost unbearable; however, he remained quietly
awaiting the return of the young lady without giving a
thought to the why and wherefore of his present
position.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mêng Lung-t‘an had noticed the sudden
disappearance of his friend, and thinking something was
wrong, asked the priest where he was. “He has gone
to hear the preaching of the Law,” replied the priest.
“Where?” said Mr. Mêng. “Oh, not very far,” was
the answer. Then with his finger the old priest tapped
the wall and called out, “Friend Chu! what makes you
stay away so long?” At this, the likeness of Mr. Chu
was figured upon the wall, with his ear inclined in the
attitude of one listening. The priest added, “Your
friend here has been waiting for you some time;”
and immediately Mr. Chu descended from the wall,
standing transfixed like a block of wood, with starting
eyeballs and trembling legs. Mr. Mêng was much terrified,
and asked him quietly what was the matter.
Now the matter was that while concealed under the
bed he had heard a noise resembling thunder and had
rushed out to see what it was.</p>

<p>Here they all noticed that the young lady on the
wall with the maiden’s tresses had changed the style
of her <i xml:lang="fr">coiffure</i> to that of a married woman. Mr. Chu
was greatly astonished at this and asked the old priest
the reason.</p>

<p>He replied, “Visions have their origin in those who
see them: what explanation can I give?” This answer
<span class="pagenum" title="i-13"><a id="Page_i-13"></a></span>
was very unsatisfactory to Mr. Chu; neither did his
friend, who was rather frightened, know what to make
of it all; so they descended the temple steps and
went away.</p>

<br/>
PLANTING A PEAR-TREE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A countryman</span> was one day selling his pears in
the market. They were unusually sweet and fine flavoured,
and the price he asked was high. A Taoist<a id="Anchor-46" title="Go to Footnote 46" href="#Footnote-46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
priest in rags and tatters stopped at the barrow and
<span class="pagenum" title="i-15"><a id="Page_i-15"></a></span>
begged one of them. The countryman told him to go
away, but as he did not do so he began to curse and
swear at him. The priest said, “You have several
hundred pears on your barrow; I ask for a single one,
the loss of which, Sir, you would not feel. Why then
get angry?” The lookers-on told the countryman to
give him an inferior one and let him go, but this he
obstinately refused to do. Thereupon the beadle of
the place, finding the commotion too great, purchased
a pear and handed it to the priest. The latter received
it with a bow and turning to the crowd said,
“We who have left our homes and given up all that
is dear to us<a id="Anchor-47" title="Go to Footnote 47" href="#Footnote-47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> are at a loss to understand selfish niggardly
conduct in others. Now I have some exquisite
pears which I shall do myself the honour to put before
you.” Here somebody asked, “Since you have pears
yourself, why don’t you eat those?” “Because,” replied
the priest, “I wanted one of these pips to grow them
from.” So saying, he munched up the pear; and when
he had finished took a pip in his hand, unstrapped a
pick from his back, and proceeded to make a hole in
the ground, several inches deep, wherein he deposited
the pip, filling in the earth as before. He then asked
the bystanders for a little hot water to water it with,
and one among them who loved a joke fetched him
some boiling water from a neighbouring shop. The
<span class="pagenum" title="i-16"><a id="Page_i-16"></a></span>
priest poured this over the place where he had made
the hole, and every eye was fixed upon him when
sprouts were seen shooting up, and gradually growing
larger and larger. By-and-by, there was a tree with
branches sparsely covered with leaves; then flowers,
and last of all fine, large, sweet-smelling pears hanging
in great profusion. These the priest picked and handed
round to the assembled crowd until all were gone, when
he took his pick and hacked away for a long time at
the tree, finally cutting it down. This he shouldered,
leaves and all, and sauntered quietly away. Now, from
the very beginning, our friend the countryman had been
amongst the crowd, straining his neck to see what was
going on, and forgetting all about his business. At the
departure of the priest he turned round and discovered
that every one of his pears was gone. He then knew
that those the old fellow had been giving away so freely
were really his own pears. Looking more closely at the
barrow he also found that one of the handles was missing,
evidently having been newly cut off. Boiling with
rage, he set out in pursuit of the priest, and just as he
turned the corner he saw the lost barrow-handle lying
under the wall, being in fact the very pear-tree that the
priest had cut down. But there were no traces of the
priest&mdash;much to the amusement of the crowd in the
market-place.</p>

THE TAOIST PRIEST OF LAO-SHAN.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">There</span> lived in our village a Mr. Wang, the seventh
son in an old family. This gentleman had a <i>penchant</i>
for the Taoist religion; and hearing that at Lao-shan
there were plenty of Immortals,<a id="Anchor-48" title="Go to Footnote 48" href="#Footnote-48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> shouldered his knapsack
and went off for a tour thither. Ascending a peak of
the mountain he reached a secluded monastery where he
found a priest sitting on a rush mat, with long hair
flowing over his neck, and a pleasant expression on his
face. Making a low bow, Wang addressed him thus:&mdash;“Mysterious
indeed is the doctrine: I pray you, Sir,
instruct me therein.” “Delicately-nurtured and wanting
in energy as you are,” replied the priest, “I fear you
could not support the fatigue.” “Try me,” said Wang.
<span class="pagenum" title="i-18"><a id="Page_i-18"></a></span>
So when the disciples, who were very many in number,
collected together at dusk, Wang joined them in making
obeisance to the priest, and remained with them in the
monastery. Very early next morning the priest summoned
Wang, and giving him a hatchet sent him out
with the others to cut firewood. Wang respectfully
obeyed, continuing to work for over a month until his
hands and feet were so swollen and blistered that he
secretly meditated returning home. One evening when
he came back he found two strangers sitting drinking
with his master. It being already dark, and no lamp or
candles having been brought in, the old priest took some
scissors and cut out a circular piece of paper like a
mirror, which he proceeded to stick against the wall.
Immediately it became a dazzling moon, by the light of
which you could have seen a hair or a beard of corn.
The disciples all came crowding round to wait upon
them, but one of the strangers said, “On a festive
occasion like this we ought all to enjoy ourselves together.”
Accordingly he took a kettle of wine from the
table and presented it to the disciples, bidding them
drink each his fill; whereupon our friend Wang began to
wonder how seven or eight of them could all be served
out of a single kettle. The disciples, too, rushed about
in search of cups, each struggling to get the first drink
for fear the wine should be exhausted. Nevertheless, all
the candidates failed to empty the kettle, at which they
were very much astonished, when suddenly one of the
strangers said, “You have given us a fine bright moon;
but it’s dull work drinking by ourselves. Why not call
<span class="pagenum" title="i-19"><a id="Page_i-19"></a></span>
Ch‘ang-ngo<a id="Anchor-49" title="Go to Footnote 49" href="#Footnote-49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> to join us?” He then seized a chop-stick
and threw it into the moon, whereupon a lovely girl
stepped forth from its beams. At first she was only a
foot high, but on reaching the ground lengthened to the
ordinary size of women. She had a slender waist and a
beautiful neck, and went most gracefully through the
Red Garment figure.<a id="Anchor-50" title="Go to Footnote 50" href="#Footnote-50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> When this was finished she sang
the following <span class="nowrap">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse_i-0-5">“Ye fairies! ye fairies! I’m coming back soon,</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">Too lonely and cold is my home in the moon.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Her voice was clear and well sustained, ringing like the
notes of a flageolet, and when she had concluded her
song she pirouetted round and jumped up on the
table, where, with every eye fixed in astonishment
upon her, she once more became a chop-stick. The
three friends laughed loudly, and one of them said,
“We are very jolly to-night, but I have hardly room for
any more wine. Will you drink a parting glass with me
in the palace of the moon?” They then took up the
table and walked into the moon where they could be
seen drinking so plainly, that their eyebrows and beards
appeared like reflections in a looking-glass. By-and-by
the moon became obscured; and when the disciples
<span class="pagenum" title="i-20"><a id="Page_i-20"></a></span>
brought a lighted candle they found the priest sitting in
the dark alone. The viands, however, were still upon
the table and the mirror-like piece of paper on the wall.
“Have you all had enough to drink?” asked the priest;
to which they answered that they had. “In that case,”
said he, “you had better get to bed, so as not to be
behindhand with your wood-cutting in the morning.”
So they all went off, and among them Wang, who was
delighted at what he had seen, and thought no more of
returning home. But after a time he could not stand it
any longer; and as the priest taught him no magical arts
he determined not to wait, but went to him and said,
“Sir, I travelled many long miles for the benefit of your
instruction. If you will not teach me the secret of Immortality,
let me at any rate learn some trifling trick, and
thus soothe my cravings for a knowledge of your art. I
have now been here two or three months, doing nothing
but chop firewood, out in the morning and back at
night, work to which I was never accustomed in my own
home.” “Did I not tell you,” replied the priest, “that
you would never support the fatigue? To-morrow I will
start you on your way home.” “Sir,” said Wang, “I
have worked for you a long time. Teach me some
small art, that my coming here may not have been
wholly in vain.” “What art?” asked the priest.
“Well,” answered Wang, “I have noticed that whenever
you walk about anywhere, walls and so on are no
obstacle to you. Teach me this, and I’ll be satisfied.”
The priest laughingly assented, and taught Wang a
formula which he bade him recite. When he had
<span class="pagenum" title="i-21"><a id="Page_i-21"></a></span>
done so he told him to walk through the wall; but
Wang, seeing the wall in front of him, didn’t like to
walk at it. As, however, the priest bade him try, he
walked quietly up to it and was there stopped. The
priest here called out, “Don’t go so slowly. Put your
head down and rush at it.” So Wang stepped back a
few paces and went at it full speed; and the wall
yielding to him as he passed, in a moment he found
himself outside. Delighted at this, he went in to thank
the priest, who told him to be careful in the use of his
power, or otherwise there would be no response, handing
him at the same time some money for his expenses on
the way. When Wang got home, he went about bragging
of his Taoist friends and his contempt for walls in
general; but as his wife disbelieved his story, he set
about going through the performance as before. Stepping
back from the wall, he rushed at it full speed with
his head down; but coming in contact with the hard
bricks, finished up in a heap on the floor. His wife
picked him up and found he had a bump on his forehead
as big as a large egg, at which she roared with
laughter; but Wang was overwhelmed with rage and
shame, and cursed the old priest for his base ingratitude.</p>

<br/>
THE BUDDHIST PRIEST OF CH‘ANG-CH‘ING.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Ch‘ang-ch‘ing there lived a Buddhist priest of exceptional
virtue and purity of conduct, who, though
over eighty years of age, was still hale and hearty. One
day he fell down and could not move; and when the
other priests rushed to help him up, they found he was
already gone. The old priest was himself unconscious
of death, and his soul flew away to the borders of the
province of Honan. Now it chanced that the scion of
an old family residing in Honan, had gone out that very
day with some ten or a dozen followers to hunt the hare
with falcons;<a id="Anchor-51" title="Go to Footnote 51" href="#Footnote-51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> but his horse having run away with him
<span class="pagenum" title="i-23"><a id="Page_i-23"></a></span>
he fell off and was killed. Just at that moment the soul
of the priest came by and entered into the body, which
thereupon gradually recovered consciousness. The
servants crowded round to ask him how he felt, when
opening his eyes wide, he cried out, “How did I get
here?” They assisted him to rise, and led him into
the house, where all his ladies came to see him and
inquire how he did. In great amazement he said, “I
am a Buddhist priest. How came I hither?” His
servants thought he was wandering, and tried to recall
him by pulling his ears. As for himself, he could make
nothing of it, and closing his eyes refrained from saying
anything further. For food, he would only eat rice,
refusing all wine and meat; and avoided the society of
his wives.<a id="Anchor-52" title="Go to Footnote 52" href="#Footnote-52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> After some days he felt inclined for a stroll,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-24"><a id="Page_i-24"></a></span>
at which all his family were delighted; but no sooner
had he got outside and stopped for a little rest than he
was besieged by servants begging him to take their
accounts as usual. However, he pleaded illness and
want of strength, and no more was said. He then took
occasion to ask if they knew the district of Ch‘ang-ch‘ing,
and on being answered in the affirmative expressed
his intention of going thither for a trip, as he
felt dull and had nothing particular to do, bidding them
at the same time look after his affairs at home. They
tried to dissuade him from this on the ground of his
having but recently risen from a sick bed; but he paid
no heed to their remonstrances, and on the very next
day set out. Arriving in the Ch‘ang-ch‘ing district, he
found everything unchanged; and without being put to
the necessity of asking the road, made his way straight
to the monastery. His former disciples received him
with every token of respect as an honoured visitor; and
in reply to his question as to where the old priest was,
they informed him that their worthy teacher had been
dead for some time. On asking to be shewn his grave,
they led him to a spot where there was a solitary mound
some three feet high, over which the grass was not yet
green. Not one of them knew his motives for visiting
this place; and by-and-by he ordered his horse, saying
to the disciples, “Your master was a virtuous priest.
Carefully preserve whatever relics of him you may have,
and keep them from injury.” They all promised to do
this, and he then set off on his way home. When he
arrived there, he fell into a listless state and took no
<span class="pagenum" title="i-25"><a id="Page_i-25"></a></span>
interest in his family affairs. So much so, that after a
few months he ran away and went straight to his former
home at the monastery, telling the disciples that he was
their old master. This they refused to believe, and
laughed among themselves at his pretensions; but he
told them the whole story, and recalled many incidents
of his previous life among them, until at last they were
convinced. He then occupied his old bed and went
through the same daily routine as before, paying no attention
to the repeated entreaties of his family, who
came with carriages and horses to beg him to return.</p>

<p>About a year subsequently, his wife sent one of the
servants with splendid presents of gold and silk, all of
which he refused with the exception of a single linen
robe. And whenever any of his old friends passed this
monastery, they always went to pay him their respects,
finding him quiet, dignified, and pure. He was then
barely thirty, though he had been a priest for more than
eighty years.<a id="Anchor-53" title="Go to Footnote 53" href="#Footnote-53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<br/>
THE MARRIAGE OF THE FOX’S
DAUGHTER.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A president</span> of the Board of Civil Office,<a id="Anchor-54" title="Go to Footnote 54" href="#Footnote-54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> named
Yin, and a native of Li-ch‘êng, when a young man, was
very badly off, but was endowed with considerable physical
courage. Now in his part of the country there was
a large establishment, covering several acres, with an unbroken
succession of pavilions and verandahs, and
belonging to one of the old county families; but
because ghosts and apparitions were frequently seen
there, the place had for a long time remained untenanted,
and was overgrown with grass and weeds, no
one venturing to enter in even in broad daylight. One
evening when Yin was carousing with some fellow-students,
one of them jokingly said, “If anybody will
pass a night in the haunted house, the rest of us will
stand him a dinner.” Mr. Yin jumped up at this, and
cried out, “What is there difficult in that?” So, taking
with him a sleeping-mat, he proceeded thither, escorted by
<span class="pagenum" title="i-27"><a id="Page_i-27"></a></span>
all his companions as far as the door, where they laughed
and said, “We will wait here a little while. In case you
see anything, shout out to us at once.” “If there are
any goblins or foxes,” replied Yin, “I’ll catch them for
you.” He then went in, and found the paths obliterated
by long grass, which had sprung up, mingled with weeds
of various kinds. It was just the time of the new moon,
and by its feeble light he was able to make out the door
of the house. Feeling his way, he walked on until he
reached the back pavilion, and then went up on to the
Moon Terrace, which was such a pleasant spot that he
determined to stop there. Gazing westwards, he sat for
a long time looking at the moon&mdash;a single thread of
light embracing in its horns the peak of a hill&mdash;without
hearing anything at all unusual; so, laughing to himself
at the nonsense people talked, he spread his mat upon
the floor, put a stone under his head for a pillow, and
lay down to sleep. He had watched the Cow-herd and
the Lady<a id="Anchor-55" title="Go to Footnote 55" href="#Footnote-55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> until they were just disappearing, and was on
the point of dropping off, when suddenly he heard footsteps
down below coming up the stairs. Pretending to
be asleep, he saw a servant enter, carrying in his hand a
lotus-shaped lantern,<a id="Anchor-56" title="Go to Footnote 56" href="#Footnote-56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> who, on observing Mr. Yin, rushed
back in a fright, and said to someone behind, “There is
a stranger here!” The person spoken to asked who it
was, but the servant did not know; and then up came
<span class="pagenum" title="i-28"><a id="Page_i-28"></a></span>
an old gentleman, who, after examining Mr. Yin closely,
said, “It’s the future President: he’s as drunk as can be.
We needn’t mind him; besides, he’s a good fellow, and
won’t give us any trouble.” So they walked in and
opened all the doors; and by-and-by there were a great
many other people moving about, and quantities of
lamps were lighted, till the place was as light as day.
About this time Mr. Yin slightly changed his position,
and sneezed; upon which the old man, perceiving that
he was awake, came forward and fell down on his knees,
saying, “Sir, I have a daughter who is to be married this
very night. It was not anticipated that Your Honour
would be here. I pray, therefore, that we may be excused.”
Mr. Yin got up and raised the old man,
regretting that, in his ignorance of the festive occasion,
he had brought with him no present.<a id="Anchor-57" title="Go to Footnote 57" href="#Footnote-57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> “Ah, Sir,” replied
the old man, “your very presence here will ward off all
noxious influences; and that is quite enough for us.”
He then begged Mr. Yin to assist in doing the honours,
and thus double the obligation already conferred. Mr.
Yin readily assented, and went inside to look at the
gorgeous arrangements they had made. He was here
met by a lady, apparently about forty years of age, whom
the old gentleman introduced as his wife; and he had
hardly made his bow when he heard the sound of
flageolets,<a id="Anchor-58" title="Go to Footnote 58" href="#Footnote-58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and someone came hurrying in, saying,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-29"><a id="Page_i-29"></a></span>
“He has come!” The old gentleman flew out to meet
this personage, and Mr. Yin also stood up, awaiting his
arrival. In no long time, a bevy of people with gauze
lanterns ushered in the bridegroom himself, who seemed
to be about seventeen or eighteen years old, and of a
most refined and prepossessing appearance. The old
gentleman bade him pay his respects first to their worthy
guest; and upon his looking towards Mr. Yin, that
gentleman came forward to welcome him on behalf of
the host. Then followed ceremonies between the old
man and his son-in-law; and when these were over, they
all sat down to supper. Hosts of waiting-maids brought
in profuse quantities of wine and meats, with bowls and
cups of jade or gold, till the table glittered again. And
when the wine had gone round several times, the old
gentleman told one of the maids to summon the bride.
This she did, but some time passed and no bride came.
So the old man rose and drew aside the curtain, pressing
the young lady to come forth; whereupon a number of
women escorted out the bride, whose ornaments went
<i>tinkle tinkle</i> as she walked along, sweet perfumes being
all the time diffused around. Her father told her to
make the proper salutation, after which she went and sat
by her mother. Mr. Yin took a glance at her, and saw
that she wore on her head beautiful ornaments made of
kingfisher’s feathers, her beauty quite surpassing anything
he had ever seen. All this time they had been
drinking their wine out of golden goblets big enough to
hold several pints, when it flashed across him that one of
these goblets would be a capital thing to carry back to
<span class="pagenum" title="i-30"><a id="Page_i-30"></a></span>
his companions in evidence of what he had seen. So he
secreted it in his sleeve, and, pretending to be tipsy,<a id="Anchor-59" title="Go to Footnote 59" href="#Footnote-59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
leaned forward with his head upon the table as if going
off to sleep. “The gentleman is drunk,” said the
guests; and by-and-by Mr. Yin heard the bridegroom
take his leave, and there was a general trooping downstairs
to the tune of a wedding march. When they were
all gone the old gentleman collected the goblets, one of
which was missing, though they hunted high and low to
find it. Someone mentioned the sleeping guest; but the
old gentleman stopped him at once for fear Mr. Yin
should hear, and before long silence reigned throughout.
Mr. Yin then arose. It was dark, and he had no light;
but he could detect the lingering smell of the food, and
the place was filled with the fumes of wine. Faint
streaks of light now appearing in the east, he began
quietly to make a move, having first satisfied himself
that the goblet was still in his sleeve. Arriving at the
door, he found his friends already there; for they had
been afraid he might come out after they left, and go in
again early in the morning. When he produced the
goblet they were all lost in astonishment; and on hearing
<span class="pagenum" title="i-31"><a id="Page_i-31"></a></span>
his story, they were fain to believe it, well knowing
that a poor student like Yin was not likely to have such
a valuable piece of plate in his possession.</p>

<p>Later on Mr. Yin took his doctor’s degree, and was
appointed magistrate over the district of Fei-ch‘iu, where
there was an old-established family of the name of Chu.
The head of the family asked him to a banquet in
honour of his arrival, and ordered the servants to bring
in the large goblets. After some delay a slave-girl came
and whispered something to her master which seemed
to make him very angry. Then the goblets were brought
in, and Mr. Yin was invited to drink. He now found
that these goblets were of precisely the same shape and
pattern as the one he had at home, and at once begged
his host to tell him where he had had these made.
“Well,” said Mr. Chu, “there should be eight of them.
An ancestor of mine had them made, when he was a
minister at the capital, by an experienced artificer. They
have been handed down in our family from generation
to generation, and have now been carefully laid by for
some time; but I thought we would have them out to-day
as a compliment to your Honour. However, there
are only seven to be found. None of the servants can
have touched them, for the old seals of ten years ago are
still upon the box, unbroken. I don’t know what to
make of it.” Mr. Yin laughed, and said, “It must have
flown away! Still, it is a pity to lose an heir-loom of
that kind; and as I have a very similar one at home, I
shall take upon myself to send it to you.” When the
banquet was over, Mr. Yin went home, and taking out
<span class="pagenum" title="i-32"><a id="Page_i-32"></a></span>
his own goblet, sent it off to Mr. Chu. The latter was
somewhat surprised to find that it was identical with his
own, and hurried away to thank the magistrate for his
gift, asking him at the same time how it had come into
his possession. Mr. Yin told him the whole story, which
proves conclusively that although a fox may obtain possession
of a thing, even at a distance of many hundred
miles, he will not venture to keep it altogether.<a id="Anchor-60" title="Go to Footnote 60" href="#Footnote-60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<br/>
MISS CHIAO-NO.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">K‘ung Hsüeh-li</span> was a descendant of Confucius.<a id="Anchor-61" title="Go to Footnote 61" href="#Footnote-61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
He was a man of considerable ability, and an excellent
poet.<a id="Anchor-62" title="Go to Footnote 62" href="#Footnote-62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> A fellow-student, to whom he was much attached,
became magistrate at T‘ien-t‘ai, and sent for
K‘ung to join him. Unfortunately, just before K‘ung
<span class="pagenum" title="i-34"><a id="Page_i-34"></a></span>
arrived his friend died, and he found himself without
the means of returning home; so he took up his abode
in a Buddhist monastery, where he was employed in
transcribing for the priests. Several hundred paces to
the west of this monastery there was a house belonging
to a Mr. Shan, a gentleman who had known better days,
but who had spent all his money in a heavy law-suit;
and then, as his family was a small one, had gone away
to live in the country and left his house vacant. One
day there was a heavy fall of snow which kept visitors
away from the monastery; and K‘ung, finding it dull,
went out. As he was passing by the door of the house
above-mentioned, a young man of very elegant appearance
came forth, who, the moment he saw K‘ung, ran
up to him, and with a bow, entered into conversation,
asking him to be pleased to walk in. K‘ung was much
taken with the young man, and followed him inside.
The rooms were not particularly large, but adorned
<span class="pagenum" title="i-35"><a id="Page_i-35"></a></span>
throughout with embroidered curtains, and from the
walls hung scrolls and drawings by celebrated masters.
On the table lay a book, the title of which was,
“Jottings from Paradise;” and turning over its leaves,
K‘ung found therein many strange things. He did not
ask the young man his name, presuming that as he
lived in the Shan family mansion, he was necessarily the
owner of the place. The young man, however, inquired
what he was doing in that part of the country, and
expressed great sympathy with his misfortunes, recommending
him to set about taking pupils. “Alas!” said
K‘ung, “who will play the Mæcenas to a distressed
wayfarer like myself?” “If,” replied the young man,
“you would condescend so far, I for my part would
gladly seek instruction at your hands.” K‘ung was
much gratified at this, but said he dared not arrogate to
himself the position of teacher, and begged merely to
be considered as the young man’s friend. He then
asked him why the house had been shut up for so long;
to which the young man replied, “This is the Shan
family mansion. It has been closed all this time
because of the owner’s removal into the country. My
surname is Huang-fu, and my home is in Shen-si; but
as our house has been burnt down in a great fire, we
have put up here for a while.” Thus Mr. K‘ung found
out that his name was not Shan. That evening they
spent in laughing and talking together, and K‘ung
remained there for the night. In the morning a lad
came in to light the fire; and the young man, rising first,
went into the private part of the house. Mr. K‘ung
<span class="pagenum" title="i-36"><a id="Page_i-36"></a></span>
was sitting up with the bed-clothes still huddled round
him, when the lad looked in and said, “Master’s
coming!” So he jumped up with a start, and in
came an old man with a silvery beard, who began to
thank him, saying, “I am very much obliged to you
for your condescension in becoming my son’s tutor.
At present he writes a <a id="tn_1">villainous</a> hand; and I can only
hope you will not allow the ties of friendship to interfere
with discipline.” Thereupon, he presented Mr.
K‘ung with an embroidered suit of clothes, a sable hat,
and a set of shoes and stockings; and when the latter
had washed and dressed himself he called for wine and
food. K‘ung could not make out what the valances
of the chairs and tables were made of: they were so
very bright-coloured and dazzling. By-and-by, when
the wine had circulated several times, the old gentleman
picked up his walking-stick and took his leave. After
breakfast, the young man handed in his theme, which
turned out to be written in an archaic style, and not at all
after the modern fashion of essay-writing. K‘ung asked
him why he had done this, to which the young man
replied that he did not contemplate competing at the
public examinations. In the evening they had another
drinking-bout, but it was agreed that there should be
no more of it after that night. The young man then
called the boy and told him to see if his father was
asleep or not; adding, that if he was, he might quietly
summon Miss Perfume. The boy went off, first taking
a guitar out of a very pretty case; and in a few minutes
in came a very nice-looking young girl. The young
<span class="pagenum" title="i-37"><a id="Page_i-37"></a></span>
man bade her play the <cite>Death of Shun;</cite><a id="Anchor-63" title="Go to Footnote 63" href="#Footnote-63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and seizing an
ivory plectrum she swept the chords, pouring forth a
vocal melody of exquisite sweetness and pathos. He
then gave her a goblet of wine to drink, and it was
midnight before they parted. Next morning they got
up early and settled down to work. The young man
proved an apt scholar; he could remember what he had
once read, and at the end of two or three months had
made astonishing progress. Then they agreed that
every five days they would indulge in a symposium, and
that Miss Perfume should always be of the party. One
night when the wine had gone into K‘ung’s head, he
seemed to be lost in a reverie; whereupon his young
friend, who knew what was the matter with him, said,
“This girl was brought up by my father. I know you
find it lonely, and I have long been looking out for a nice
wife for you.” “Let her only resemble Miss Perfume,”
said K‘ung, “and she will do.” “Your experience,”
said the young man, laughing, “is but limited, and, consequently,
anything is a surprise to you. If Miss
Perfume is your <i xml:lang="fr">beau ideal</i>, why it will not be difficult
to satisfy you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="i-38"><a id="Page_i-38"></a></span>
Some six months had passed away, when one day
Mr. K‘ung took it into his head that he would like to
go out for a stroll in the country. The entrance, however,
was carefully closed; and on asking the reason,
the young man told him that his father wished to receive
no guests for fear of causing interruption to his studies.
So K‘ung thought no more about it; and by-and-by,
when the heat of summer came on, they moved their
study to a pavilion in the garden. At this time Mr.
K‘ung had a swelling on the chest about as big as a
peach, which, in a single night, increased to the size of a
bowl. There he lay groaning with the pain, while his
pupil waited upon him day and night. He slept badly
and took hardly any food; and in a few days the place
got so much worse that he could neither eat nor drink.
The old gentleman also came in, and he and his son
lamented over him together. Then the young man said,
“I was thinking last night that my sister, Chiao-no, would
be able to cure Mr. K‘ung, and accordingly I sent over
to my grandmother’s asking her to come. She ought
to be here by now.” At that moment a servant entered
and announced Miss Chiao-no, who had come with her
cousin, having been at her aunt’s house. Her father
and brother ran out to meet her, and then brought her
in to see Mr. K‘ung. She was between thirteen and
fourteen years old, and had beautiful eyes with a very
intelligent expression in them, and a most graceful figure
besides. No sooner had Mr. K‘ung beheld this lovely
creature than he quite forgot to groan, and began to
brighten up. Meanwhile the young man was saying,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-39"><a id="Page_i-39"></a></span>
“This respected friend of mine is the same to me as a
brother. Try, sister, to cure him.” Miss Chiao-no immediately
dismissed her blushes, and rolling up her long
sleeves approached the bed to feel his pulse.<a id="Anchor-64" title="Go to Footnote 64" href="#Footnote-64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> As she
was grasping his wrist, K‘ung became conscious of a
perfume more delicate than that of the epidendrum;
and then she laughed, saying, “This illness was to be
expected; for the heart is touched. Though it is severe,
a cure can be effected; but, as there is already a swelling,
not without using the knife.” Then she drew from
her arm a gold bracelet which she pressed down upon
the suffering spot, until by degrees the swelling rose
within the bracelet and overtopped it by an inch and
more, the outlying parts that were inflamed also passing
under, and thus very considerably reducing the extent of
the tumour. With one hand she opened her robe and
took out a knife with an edge as keen as paper, and
pressing the bracelet down all the time with the other,
proceeded to cut lightly round near the root of the
swelling. The dark blood gushed forth, and stained the
bed and the mat; but Mr. K‘ung was delighted to be
near such a beauty,&mdash;not only felt no pain, but would
willingly have continued the operation that she might
sit by him a little longer. In a few moments the whole
<span class="pagenum" title="i-40"><a id="Page_i-40"></a></span>
thing was removed, and the place looked like the knot
on a tree where a branch has been cut away. Here
Miss Chiao-no called for water to wash the wound, and
from between her lips she took a red pill as big as a
bullet, which she laid upon the flesh, and, after drawing
the skin together, passed round and round the place.
The first turn felt like the searing of a hot iron; the
second like a gentle itching; and at the third he experienced
a sensation of lightness and coolness which
penetrated into his very bones and marrow. The young
lady then returned the pill to her mouth, and said, “He
is cured,” hurrying away as fast as she could. Mr.
K‘ung jumped up to thank her, and found that his complaint
had quite disappeared. Her beauty, however,
had made such an impression on him that his troubles
were hardly at an end. From this moment he gave up
his books, and took no interest in anything. This state
of things was soon noticed by the young man, who said
to him, “My brother, I have found a fine match for
you.” “Who is it to be?” asked K‘ung. “Oh, one
of the family,” replied his friend. Thereupon Mr.
K‘ung remained some time lost in thought, and at
length said, “Please don’t!” Then turning his face to
the wall, he repeated these <span class="nowrap">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse_i-0-5">“Speak not of lakes and streams to him who once has seen the sea;</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">The clouds that circle Wu’s peak are the only clouds for me.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The young man guessed to whom he was alluding,
and replied, “My father has a very high opinion of
<span class="pagenum" title="i-41"><a id="Page_i-41"></a></span>
your talents, and would gladly receive you into the
family, but that he has only one daughter, and she is
much too young. My cousin, Ah-sung, however, is
seventeen years old, and not at all a bad-looking girl.
If you doubt my word, you can wait in the verandah
until she takes her daily walk in the garden, and thus
judge for yourself.” This Mr. K‘ung acceded to, and
accordingly saw Miss Chiao-no come out with a lovely
girl&mdash;her black eyebrows beautifully arched, and her
tiny feet encased in phœnix-shaped shoes&mdash;as like one
another as they well could be. He was of course delighted,
and begged the young man to arrange all
preliminaries; and the very next day his friend came
to tell him that the affair was finally settled. A portion
of the house was given up to the bride and bridegroom,
and the marriage was celebrated with plenty of music
and hosts of guests, more like a fairy wedding than anything
else. Mr. K‘ung was very happy, and began to
think that the position of Paradise had been wrongly
laid down, until one day the young man came to him
and said, “For the trouble you have been at in teaching
me, I shall ever remain your debtor. At the present
moment, the Shan family law-suit has been brought to a
termination, and they wish to resume possession of their
house immediately. We therefore propose returning to
Shen-si, and as it is unlikely that you and I will ever meet
again, I feel very sorrowful at the prospect of parting.”
Mr. K‘ung replied that he would go too, but the young
man advised him to return to his old home. This, he
observed, was no easy matter; upon which the young
<span class="pagenum" title="i-42"><a id="Page_i-42"></a></span>
man said, “Don’t let that trouble you: I will see you
safe there.” By-and-by his father came in with Mr.
K‘ung’s wife, and presented Mr. K‘ung with one hundred
ounces of gold; and then the young man gave the
husband and wife each one of his hands to grasp,
bidding them shut their eyes. The next instant they
were floating away in the air, with the wind whizzing in
their ears. In a little while he said, “You have arrived,”
and opening his eyes, K‘ung beheld his former
home. Then he knew that the young man was not a
human being. Joyfully he knocked at the old door,
and his mother was astonished to see him arrive with
such a nice wife. They were all rejoicing together, when
he turned round and found that his friend had disappeared.
His wife attended on her mother-in-law with
great devotion, and acquired a reputation both for
virtue and beauty, which was spread round far and
near. Some time passed away, and then Mr. K‘ung
took his doctor’s degree, and was appointed Governor of
the Gaol in Yen-ngan. He proceeded to his post with
his wife only, the journey being too long for his mother,
and by-and-by a son was born. Then he got into
trouble by being too honest an official, and threw up his
appointment; but had not the wherewithal to get home
again. One day when out hunting he met a handsome
young man riding on a nice horse, and seeing that he
was staring very hard looked closely at him. It was
young Huang-fu. So they drew bridle, and fell to
laughing and crying by turns,&mdash;the young man then inviting
K‘ung to go along with him. They rode on
<span class="pagenum" title="i-43"><a id="Page_i-43"></a></span>
together until they had reached a village thickly shaded
with trees, so that the sun and sky were invisible overhead,
and entered into a most elaborately-decorated
mansion, such as might belong to an old-established
family. K‘ung asked after Miss Chiao-no, and heard
that she was married; also that his own mother-in-law
was dead, at which tidings he was greatly moved. Next
day he went back and returned again with his wife.
Chiao-no also joined them, and taking up K‘ung’s
child played with it, saying, “Your mother played us
truant.” Mr. K‘ung did not forget to thank her for her
former kindness to him, to which she replied, “You’re
a great man now. Though the wound has healed,
haven’t you forgotten the pain yet?” Her husband,
too, came to pay his respects, returning with her on the
following morning. One day the young Huang-fu
seemed troubled in spirit, and said to Mr. K‘ung, “A
great calamity is impending. Can you help us?” Mr.
K‘ung did not know what he was alluding to, but
readily promised his assistance. The young man then
ran out and summoned the whole family to worship in
the ancestral hall, at which Mr. K‘ung was alarmed, and
asked what it all meant. “You know,” answered the
young man, “I am not a man but a fox. To-day we
shall be attacked by thunder;<a id="Anchor-65" title="Go to Footnote 65" href="#Footnote-65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and if only you will aid
<span class="pagenum" title="i-44"><a id="Page_i-44"></a></span>
us in our trouble, we may still hope to escape. If you
are unwilling, take your child and go, that you may not
be involved with us.” Mr. K‘ung protested he would
live or die with them, and so the young man placed him
with a sword at the door, bidding him remain quiet
there in spite of all the thunder. He did as he was
told, and soon saw black clouds obscuring the light
until it was all as dark as pitch. Looking round, he could
see that the house had disappeared, and that its place
was occupied by a huge mound and a bottomless pit.
In the midst of his terror, a fearful peal was heard
which shook the very hills, accompanied by a violent
wind and driving rain. Old trees were torn up, and Mr.
K‘ung became both dazed and deaf. Yet he stood firm
until he saw in a dense black column of smoke a horrid
thing with a sharp beak and long claws, with which it
snatched some one from the hole, and was disappearing
up with the smoke. In an instant K‘ung knew by her
clothes and shoes that the victim was no other than
Chiao-no, and instantly jumping up he struck the devil
violently with his sword, and cut it down. Immediately
the mountains were riven, and a sharp peal of thunder
laid K‘ung dead upon the ground. Then the clouds
cleared away, and Chiao-no gradually came round, to
find K‘ung dead at her feet. She burst out crying at
the sight, and declared that she would not live since
K‘ung had died for her. K‘ung’s wife also came out,
and they bore the body inside. Chiao-no then made
Ah-sung hold her husband’s head, while her brother
prised open his teeth with a hair-pin, and she herself
<span class="pagenum" title="i-45"><a id="Page_i-45"></a></span>
arranged his jaw. She next put a red pill into his
mouth, and bending down breathed into him. The pill
went along with the current of air, and presently there
was a gurgle in his throat, and he came round. Seeing
all the family about him, he was disturbed as if waking
from a dream. However they were all united together,
and fear gave place to joy; but Mr. K‘ung objected
to live in that out-of-the-way place, and proposed that
they should return with him to his native village. To
this they were only too pleased to assent&mdash;all except
Chiao-no; and when Mr. K‘ung invited her husband,
Mr. Wu, as well, she said she feared her father and
mother-in-law would not like to lose the children.
They had tried all day to persuade her, but without
success, when suddenly in rushed one of the Wu
family’s servants, dripping with perspiration and quite
out of breath. They asked what was the matter, and
the servant replied that the Wu family had been visited
by a calamity on the very same day, and had every
one perished. Chiao-no cried very bitterly at this, and
could not be comforted; but now there was nothing
to prevent them from all returning together. Mr.
K‘ung went into the city for a few days on business,
and then they set to work packing-up night and day.
On arriving at their destination, separate apartments
were allotted to young Mr. Huang-fu, and these he
kept carefully shut up, only opening the door to Mr.
K‘ung and his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. K‘ung amused himself with the young man
and his sister Chiao-no, filling up the time with
<span class="pagenum" title="i-46"><a id="Page_i-46"></a></span>
chess,<a id="Anchor-66" title="Go to Footnote 66" href="#Footnote-66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> wine, conversation, and good cheer, as if they
had been one family. His little boy, Huan, grew
up to be a handsome young man, with a fox-like
<i>penchant</i> for roaming about; and it was generally
known that he was actually the son of a fox.</p>

MAGICAL ARTS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> Mr. Yü was a spirited young fellow, fond
of boxing and trials of strength. He was able to take
two kettles and swing them round about with the speed
of the wind. Now, during the reign of Ch‘ung Chêng,<a id="Anchor-67" title="Go to Footnote 67" href="#Footnote-67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
when up for the final examination at the capital, his
servant became seriously ill. Much troubled at this,
he applied to a necromancer in the market-place<a id="Anchor-68" title="Go to Footnote 68" href="#Footnote-68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> who
was skilful at determining the various leases of life
allotted to men. Before he had uttered a word, the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-48"><a id="Page_i-48"></a></span>
necromancer asked him, saying, “Is it not about your
servant, Sir, that you would consult me?” Mr. Yü was
startled at this, and replied that it was. “The sick man,”
continued the necromancer, “will come to no harm;
you, Sir, are the one in danger.” Mr. Yü then begged
him to cast his nativity, which he proceeded to do,
finally saying to Mr. Yü, “You have but three days
to live!” Dreadfully frightened, he remained some time
in a state of stupefaction, when the necromancer quietly
observed that he possessed the power of averting this
calamity by magic, and would exert it for the sum of
ten ounces of silver. But Mr. Yü reflected that Life
and Death are already fixed,<a id="Anchor-69" title="Go to Footnote 69" href="#Footnote-69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and he didn’t see how
magic could save him. So he refused, and was just
going away, whereupon the necromancer said, “You
grudge this trifling outlay. I hope you will not repent
it.” Mr. Yü’s friends also urged him to pay the money,
advising him rather to empty his purse than not secure
the necromancer’s compassion. Mr. Yü, however, would
not hear of it and the three days slipped quickly away.
Then he sat down calmly in his inn to see what was
going to happen. Nothing did happen all day, and
<span class="pagenum" title="i-49"><a id="Page_i-49"></a></span>
at night he shut his door and trimmed the lamp; then,
with a sword at his side, he awaited the approach of
death.</p>

<p>By-and-by, the clepsydra<a id="Anchor-70" title="Go to Footnote 70" href="#Footnote-70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> shewed that two hours had
already gone without bringing him any nearer to dissolution;
and he was thinking about lying down, when
he heard a scratching at the window, and then saw
a tiny little man creep through, carrying a spear on
his shoulder, who, on reaching the ground, shot up
to the ordinary height. Mr. Yü seized his sword and at
once struck at it; but only succeeded in cutting the air.
His visitor instantly shrunk down small again, and made
an attempt to escape through the crevice of the window;
but Yü redoubled his blows and at last brought him
to the ground. Lighting the lamp, he found only a paper
man,<a id="Anchor-71" title="Go to Footnote 71" href="#Footnote-71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> cut right through the middle. This made him
<span class="pagenum" title="i-50"><a id="Page_i-50"></a></span>
afraid to sleep, and he sat up watching, until in a little
time he saw a horrid hobgoblin creep through the same
place. No sooner did it touch the ground than he
assailed it lustily with his sword, at length cutting it in
half. Seeing, however, that both halves kept on wriggling
about, and fearing that it might get up again,
he went on hacking at it. Every blow told, giving forth
a hard sound, and when he came to examine his work,
he found a clay image all knocked to pieces. Upon
this he moved his seat near to the window, and kept
his eye fixed upon the crack. After some time, he
heard a noise like a bull bellowing outside the window,
and something pushed against the window-frame with
such force as to make the whole house tremble and seem
about to fall. Mr. Yü, fearing he should be buried
under the ruins, thought he could not do better than
fight outside; so he accordingly burst open the door
with a crash and rushed out. There he found a huge
devil, as tall as the house, and he saw by the dim light
of the moon that its face was as black as coal. Its eyes
<span class="pagenum" title="i-51"><a id="Page_i-51"></a></span>
shot forth yellow fire: it had nothing either upon its
shoulders or feet; but held a bow in its hand and had
some arrows at its waist. Mr. Yü was terrified; and the
devil discharged an arrow at him which he struck to the
ground with his sword. On Mr. Yü preparing to strike,
the devil let off another arrow which the former avoided
by jumping aside, the arrow quivering in the wall beyond
with a smart crack. The devil here got very
angry, and drawing his sword flourished it like a whirlwind,
aiming a tremendous blow at Mr. Yü. Mr. Yü
ducked, and the whole force of the blow fell upon the
stone wall of the house, cutting it right in two. Mr. Yü
then ran out from between the devil’s legs, and began
hacking at its back&mdash;whack!&mdash;whack! The devil now
became furious, and roared like thunder, turning round
to get another blow at his assailant. But Mr. Yü again
ran between his legs, the devil’s sword merely cutting
off a piece of his coat. Once more he hacked away&mdash;whack!&mdash;whack!&mdash;and
at length the devil came tumbling
down flat. Mr. Yü cut at him right and left, each blow
resounding like the watchman’s wooden gong;<a id="Anchor-72" title="Go to Footnote 72" href="#Footnote-72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and then,
bringing a light, he found it was a wooden image about
as tall as a man. The bow and arrows were still there,
the latter attached to its waist. Its carved and painted
features were most hideous to behold; and wherever
<span class="pagenum" title="i-52"><a id="Page_i-52"></a></span>
Mr. Yü had struck it with his sword, there was blood.
Mr. Yü sat with the light in his hand till morning, when
he awaked to the fact that all these devils had been
sent by the necromancer in order to kill him, and so
evidence his own magical power. The next day, after
having told the story far and wide, he went with some
others to the place where the necromancer had his stall;
but the latter, seeing them coming, vanished in the
twinkling of an eye. Some one observed that the blood
of a dog would reveal a person who had made himself
invisible, and Mr. Yü immediately procured some and
went back with it. The necromancer disappeared as
before, but on the spot where he had been standing they
quickly threw down the dog’s blood. Thereupon they
saw his head and face all smeared over with the blood, his
eyes glaring like a devil’s; and at once seizing him, they
handed him over to the authorities, by whom he was put
to death.</p>

<br/>
JOINING THE IMMORTALS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A Mr. Chou</span>, of Wên-têng, had in his youth been
fellow-student with a Mr. Ch‘êng, and a firm friendship
was the result. The latter was poor, and depended very
much upon Chou, who was the elder of the two. He
called Chou’s wife his “sister,” and had the run of the
house just as if he was one of the family. Now this wife
happening to die in child-bed, Chou married another
named Wang; but as she was quite a young girl, Ch‘êng
did not seek to be introduced.<a id="Anchor-73" title="Go to Footnote 73" href="#Footnote-73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> One day her younger
brother came to visit her, and was being entertained in
the “inner” apartments<a id="Anchor-74" title="Go to Footnote 74" href="#Footnote-74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> when Ch‘êng chanced to call.
The servant announced his arrival, and Chou bade him
ask Mr. Ch‘êng in. But Ch‘êng would not enter, and
took his leave. Thereupon Chou caused the entertainment
to be moved into the public part of the house,
and, sending after Ch‘êng, succeeded in bringing him
<span class="pagenum" title="i-54"><a id="Page_i-54"></a></span>
back. They had hardly sat down before some one came
in to say that a former servant of the establishment
had been severely beaten at the magistrate’s yamên; the
facts of the case being that a cow-boy of the Huang
family connected with the Board of Rites had driven his
cattle across the Chou family’s land, and that words had
arisen between the two servants in consequence; upon
which the Huang family’s servant had complained to his
master, who had seized the other and had sent him in to
the magistrate’s, where he had been bambooed. When Mr.
Chou found out what the matter was, he was exceedingly
angry, and said, “How dares this pig-boy fellow behave
thus? Why, only a generation ago his master was my
father’s servant! He emerges a little from his obscurity,
and immediately thinks himself I don’t know what!”
Swelling with rage, he rose to go in quest of Huang, but
Ch‘êng held him back, saying, “The age is corrupt:
there is no distinction between right and wrong. Besides,
the officials of the day are half of them thieves,
and you will only get yourself into hot water.” Chou,
however, would not listen to him; and it was only when
tears were added to remonstrances that he consented to
let the matter drop. But his anger did not cease, and
he lay tossing and turning all night. In the morning he
said to his family, “I can stand the insults of Mr.
Huang; but the magistrate is an officer of the Government,
and not the servant of influential people. If there
is a case of any kind, he should hear both plaintiff and
defendant, and not act like a dog, biting anybody he is
set upon. I will bring an action against the cow-boy,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-55"><a id="Page_i-55"></a></span>
and see what the magistrate will do to him.” As his
family rather egged him on, he accordingly proceeded to
the magistrate’s and entered a formal plaint; but that
functionary tore up his petition, and would have nothing
to do with it. This roused Chou’s anger, and he told
the magistrate plainly what he thought of him, in return
for which contempt of court he was at once seized and
bound. During the forenoon Mr. Ch‘êng called at his
house, where he learnt that Chou had gone into the city
to prosecute the cow-boy, and immediately hurried after
him with a view to stop proceedings. But his friend
was already in the gaol, and all he could do was to
stamp his foot in anger. Now it happened that three
pirates had just been caught; and the magistrate and
Huang, putting their heads together, bribed these fellows
to say that Chou was one of their gang, whereupon the
higher authorities were petitioned to deprive him of his
status as a graduate,<a id="Anchor-75" title="Go to Footnote 75" href="#Footnote-75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and the magistrate then had him
most unmercifully bambooed.<a id="Anchor-76" title="Go to Footnote 76" href="#Footnote-76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Mr. Ch‘êng gained admittance
to the gaol, and, after a painful interview,
proposed that a petition should be presented direct to
<span class="pagenum" title="i-56"><a id="Page_i-56"></a></span>
the Throne. “Alas!” cried Chou, “here am I bound
and guarded, like a bird in a cage. I have indeed a
young brother, but it is as much as he can do to provide
me with food.” Then Ch‘êng stepped forward, saying,
“I will perform this service. Of what use are friends
who will not assist in the hour of trouble?” So away
he went, and Chou’s son provided him with money to defray
his expenses. After a long journey he arrived at the
capital, where he found himself quite at a loss as to how
he should get the petition presented. However, hearing
that the Emperor was about to set out on a hunting
tour, he concealed himself in the market-place, and when
His Majesty passed by, prostrated himself on the ground
with loud cries and gesticulations. The Emperor received
his petition, and sent it to the Board of Punishments,<a id="Anchor-77" title="Go to Footnote 77" href="#Footnote-77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
desiring to be furnished with a report on the case.
It was then more than ten months since the beginning
of the affair, and Chou, who had been made to confess<a id="Anchor-78" title="Go to Footnote 78" href="#Footnote-78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
to this false charge, was already under sentence of
death; so that the officers of the Board were very much
alarmed when they received the Imperial instructions,
and set to work to re-hear the case in person. Huang
was also much alarmed, and devised a plan for killing
Mr. Chou by bribing the gaolers to stop his food and
drink; so that when his brother brought provisions he
<span class="pagenum" title="i-57"><a id="Page_i-57"></a></span>
was rudely thrust back and prevented from taking them
in. Mr. Ch‘êng complained of this to the Viceroy of
the province, who investigated the matter himself, and
found that Chou was in the last stage of starvation, for
which the gaolers were bambooed to death. Terrified
out of his wits, Huang, by dint of bribing heavily, succeeded
in absconding and escaping a just punishment
for his crimes. The magistrate, however, was banished
for perversion of the law, and Chou was permitted to
return home, his affection for Ch‘êng being now very
much increased. But ever after the prosecution and his
friend’s captivity, Mr. Ch‘êng took a dismal view of
human affairs, and one day invited Chou to retire with
him from the world. The latter, who was deeply attached
to his young wife, threw cold water on the
proposition, and Mr. Ch‘êng pursued the subject no
farther, though his own mind was fully made up. Not
seeing him for some days afterwards, Mr. Chou sent to
inquire about him at his house; but there they all
thought he was at Chou’s, neither family, in fact, having
seen anything of him. This looked suspicious, and
Chou, aware of his peculiarity, sent off people to look
for him, bidding them search all the temples and monasteries
in the neighbourhood. He also from time to
time supplied Ch‘êng’s son with money and other
necessaries.</p>

<p>Eight or nine years had passed away when suddenly
Ch‘êng re-appeared, clad in a yellow cap and stole, and
wearing the expression of a Taoist priest. Chou was
delighted, and seized his arm, saying, “Where have you
<span class="pagenum" title="i-58"><a id="Page_i-58"></a></span>
been?&mdash;letting me search for you all over the place.”
“The solitary cloud and the wild crane,” replied Ch‘êng,
laughing, “have no fixed place of abode. Since we last
met my equanimity has happily been restored.” Chou
then ordered wine, and they chatted together on what
had taken place in the interval. He also tried to persuade
Ch‘êng to detach himself from the Taoist
persuasion, but the latter only smiled and answered
nothing. “It is absurd!” argued Chou. “Why cast
aside your wife and child as you would an old pair of
shoes?” “Not so,” answered Ch‘êng; “a man may
wish to cast aside his son, but how can he do so?”
Chou asked where he lived, to which he replied, “In
the Great Pure Mansion on Mount Lao.” They then
retired to sleep on the same bed; and by-and-by Chou
dreamt that Ch‘êng was lying on his chest so that he
could not breathe. In a fright he asked him what he
was doing, but got no answer; and then he waked up
with a start. Calling to Ch‘êng and receiving no reply,
he sat up and stretched out his hand to touch him.
The latter, however, had vanished, he knew not whither.
When he got calm, he found he was lying at Ch‘êng’s
end of the bed, which rather startled him. “I was not
tipsy last night,” reflected he; “how could I have got
over here?” He next called his servants, and when
they came and struck a light, lo! he was Ch‘êng. Now
Chou had had a beard, so he put up his hand to feel for
it, but found only a few straggling hairs. He then seized a
mirror to look at himself, and cried out in alarm: “If
this is Mr. Ch‘êng, where on earth am I?” By this
<span class="pagenum" title="i-59"><a id="Page_i-59"></a></span>
time he was wide awake, and knew that Ch‘êng had
employed magic to induce him to retire from the world.
He was on the point of entering the ladies’ apartments;
but his brother, not recognising who he was, stopped
him, and would not let him go in; and as he himself
was unable to prove his own identity, he ordered his
horse that he might go in search of Ch‘êng. After
some days’ journey he arrived at Mount Lao; and, as his
horse went along at a good rate, the servant could not
keep up with him. By-and-by he rested awhile under a
tree, and saw a great number of Taoist priests going
backwards and forwards, and among them was one who
stared fixedly at him. So he inquired of him where he
should find Ch‘êng; whereat the priest laughed and said,
“I know the name. He is probably in the Great Pure
Mansion.” When he had given this answer he went on
his way, Chou following him with his eyes about a
stone’s throw, until he saw him speak with some one else,
and, after saying a few words, proceed onwards as before.
The person whom he had spoken with came on to
where Chou was, and turned out to be a fellow-townsman
of his. He was much surprised at meeting Chou, and
said, “I haven’t seen you for some years. They told
me you had gone to Mount Lao to be a Taoist priest.
How is it you are still amusing yourself among
mortals?” Chou told him who he really was; upon
which the other replied, “Why, I thought the gentleman
I just met was you! He has only just left me, and
can’t have got very far.” “Is it possible,” cried Chou,
“that I didn’t know my own face?” Just then the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-60"><a id="Page_i-60"></a></span>
servant came up, and away they went full speed, but
could not discover the object of their search. All
around them was a vast desert, and they were at a loss
whether to go on or to return. But Chou reflected that
he had no longer any home to receive him, and determined
to carry out his design to the bitter end; but as
the road was dangerous for riding, he gave his horse to
the servant, and bade him go back. On he went cautiously
by himself, until he spied a boy sitting by the
wayside alone. He hurried up to him and asked the
boy to direct him where he could find Mr. Ch‘êng. “I
am one of his disciples,” replied the lad; and, shouldering
Chou’s bundle, started off to shew the way. They
journeyed on together, taking their food by the light of
the stars, and sleeping in the open air, until, after many
miles of road, they arrived in three days at their destination.
But this Great Pure locality was not like that
generally spoken of in the world. Though as late as the
middle of the tenth moon, there was a great profusion
of flowers along the road, quite unlike the beginning of
winter. The lad went in and announced the arrival of a
stranger, whereupon Mr. Ch‘êng came out, and Chou
recognised his own features. Ch‘êng grasped his hand
and led him inside, where he prepared wine and food,
and they began to converse together. Chou noticed
many birds of strange plumage, so tame that they were
not afraid of him; and these from time to time would
alight on the table and sing with voices like Pan-pipes.
He was very much astonished at all this, but a love of
mundane pleasures had eaten into his soul, and he had
<span class="pagenum" title="i-61"><a id="Page_i-61"></a></span>
no intention of stopping. On the ground were two
rush-mats, upon which Ch‘êng invited his friend to sit
down with him. Then about midnight a serene calm
stole over him; and while he was dozing off for a
moment, he seemed to change places with Ch‘êng.
Suspecting what had happened, he put his hand up to
his chin, and found it covered with a beard as before.
At dawn he was anxious to return home, but Ch‘êng
pressed him to stay; and when three days had gone by
Ch‘êng said to him, “I pray you take a little rest now:
to-morrow I will set you on your way.” Chou had
barely closed his eyelids before he heard Ch‘êng call
out, “Everything is ready for starting!” So he got up
and followed him along a road other than that by which
he had come, and in a very short time he saw his home
in the distance. In spite of Chou’s entreaties, Ch‘êng
would not accompany him so far, but made Chou go,
waiting himself by the roadside. So the latter went
alone, and when he reached his house, knocked at the
door. Receiving no answer, he determined to get over
the wall, when he found that his body was as light as a
leaf, and with one spring he was over. In the same
manner he passed several inner walls, until he reached
the ladies’ apartments, where he saw by the still burning
lamp that the inmates had not yet retired for the night.
Hearing people talking within, he licked a hole in the
paper window<a id="Anchor-79" title="Go to Footnote 79" href="#Footnote-79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and peeped through, and saw his wife
<span class="pagenum" title="i-62"><a id="Page_i-62"></a></span>
sitting drinking with a most disreputable-looking fellow.
Bursting with rage, his first impulse was to surprise them
in the act; but seeing there were two against one, he
stole away and let himself out by the entrance-gate,
hurrying off to Ch‘êng, to whom he related what he had
seen, and finally begged his assistance. Ch‘êng willingly
went along with him; and when they reached the room,
Chou seized a big stone and hammered loudly at the
door. All was then confusion inside, so Chou hammered
again, upon which the door was barricaded more
strongly than before. Here Ch‘êng came forward with
his sword,<a id="Anchor-80" title="Go to Footnote 80" href="#Footnote-80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and burst the door open with a crash. Chou
rushed in, and the man inside rushed out; but Ch‘êng
was there, and with his sword cut his arm right off.
Chou rudely seized his wife, and asked what it all
meant; to which she replied that the man was a friend
who sometimes came to take a cup of wine with them.
Thereupon Chou borrowed Ch‘êng’s sword and cut off
her head,<a id="Anchor-81" title="Go to Footnote 81" href="#Footnote-81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> hanging up the trunk on a tree in the court-yard.
<span class="pagenum" title="i-63"><a id="Page_i-63"></a></span>
He then went back with Ch‘êng. By-and-by he
awaked and found himself on the bed, at which he was
somewhat disturbed, and said, “I have had a strangely-confused
dream, which has given me a fright.” “My
brother,” replied Ch‘êng, smiling, “you look upon
dreams as realities: you mistake realities for dreams.”
Chou asked what he meant by these words; and then
Ch‘êng shewed him his sword besmeared with blood.
Chou was terrified, and sought to destroy himself; but
all at once it occurred to him that Ch‘êng might be
deceiving him again. Ch‘êng divined his suspicions,
and made haste at once to see him home. In a little
while they arrived at the village-gate, and then Ch‘êng
said, “Was it not here that, sword in hand, I awaited
you that night? I cannot look upon the unclean spot.
I pray you go on, and let me stay here. If you do not
return by the afternoon, I will depart alone.” Chou
then approached his house, which he found all shut up
as if no one was living there; so he went into his
brother’s.</p>

<p>The latter, when he beheld Chou, began to weep
bitterly, saying, “After your departure, thieves broke
into the house and killed my sister-in-law, hanging
her body upon a tree. Alas! alas! The murderers
have not yet been caught.” Chou then told him the
whole story of his dream, and begged him to stop
further proceedings; at all of which his brother was perfectly
lost in astonishment. Chou then asked after his
son, and his brother told the nurse to bring him in;
whereupon the former said, “Upon this infant are
<span class="pagenum" title="i-64"><a id="Page_i-64"></a></span>
centered the hopes of our race.<a id="Anchor-82" title="Go to Footnote 82" href="#Footnote-82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Tend him well; for I
am going to bid adieu to the world.” He then took his
leave, his brother following him all the time with tears in
his eyes to induce him to remain. But he heeded him
not; and when they reached the village-gate his brother
saw him go away with Ch‘êng. From afar he looked back
and said, “Forbear, and be happy!” His brother would
have replied; but here Ch‘êng whisked his sleeve, and
they disappeared. The brother remained there for some
<span class="pagenum" title="i-65"><a id="Page_i-65"></a></span>
time, and then went back overwhelmed with grief. He
was an unpractical man, and before many years were
over all the property was gone and the family reduced to
poverty. Chou’s son, who was growing up, was thus
unable to secure the services of a tutor, and had no one
but his uncle to teach him. One morning, on going
into the school-room, the uncle found a letter lying on
his desk addressed to himself in his brother’s handwriting.
There was, however, nothing in it but a finger-nail
about four inches in length. Surprised at this, he
laid the nail down on the ink-slab while he went out to
ask whence the letter had come. This no one knew;
but when he went back he found that the ink-stone had
been changed into a piece of shining yellow gold. More
than ever astonished, he tried the nail on copper and
iron things, all of which were likewise turned to gold.
He thus became very rich, sharing his wealth with
Chou’s son; and it was bruited about that the two
families possessed the secret of transmutation.<a id="Anchor-83" title="Go to Footnote 83" href="#Footnote-83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<br/>
THE FIGHTING QUAILS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Wang Ch‘êng</span> belonged to an old family in P‘ing-yüan,
but was such an idle fellow that his property
gradually disappeared, until at length all he had left was
an old tumble-down house. His wife and he slept under
a coarse hempen coverlet, and the former was far from
sparing of her reproaches. At the time of which we
are speaking the weather was unbearably hot; and Wang
went to pass the night with many other of his fellow-villagers
in a pavilion which stood among some dilapidated
buildings belonging to a family named Chou.
With the first streaks of dawn his comrades departed;
but Wang slept well on till about nine o’clock, when he
got up and proceeded leisurely home. All at once he
saw in the grass a gold hair-pin; and taking it up to look
at it, found engraved thereon in small characters&mdash;“The
property of the Imperial family.” Now Wang’s
own grandfather had married into the Imperial family,<a id="Anchor-84" title="Go to Footnote 84" href="#Footnote-84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
<span class="pagenum" title="i-67"><a id="Page_i-67"></a></span>
and consequently he had formerly possessed many
similar articles; but while he was thinking it over up
came an old woman in search of the hair-pin, which
Wang, who though poor was honest, at once produced
and handed to her. The old woman was delighted, and
thanked Wang very much for his goodness, observing that
the pin was not worth much in itself, but was a relic of
her departed husband. Wang asked what her husband
had been; to which she replied, “His name was Wang
Chien-chih, and he was connected by marriage with
the Imperial family.” “My own grandfather!” cried
Wang, in great surprise; “how could you have known
him?” “You, then,” said the old woman, “are his
grandson. I am a fox, and many years ago I was
married to your grandfather; but when he died I retired
from the world. Passing by here I lost my hair-pin,
which destiny conveyed into your hands.” Wang
had heard of his grandfather’s fox-wife, and believing
therefore the old woman’s story, invited her to return
with him, which she did. Wang called his wife out to
receive her; but when she came in rags and tatters, with
unkempt hair and dirty face, the old woman sighed, and
said, “Alas! Alas! has Wang Chien-chih’s grandson
come to this?” Then looking at the broken, smokeless
<span class="pagenum" title="i-68"><a id="Page_i-68"></a></span>
stove, she added, “How, under these circumstances,
have you managed even to support life?” Here Wang’s
wife told the tale of their poverty, with much sobbing
and tears; whereupon the old woman gave her the hair-pin,
bidding her go pawn it, and with the proceeds buy
some food, saying that in three days she would visit
them again. Wang pressed her to stay, but she said,
“You can’t even keep your wife alive; what would it
benefit you to have me also dependent on you?” So
she went away, and then Wang told his wife who she
was, at which his wife felt very much alarmed; but
Wang was so loud in her praises, that finally his wife
consented to treat her with all proper respect. In three
days she returned as agreed, and, producing some
money, sent out for a hundred-weight of rice and
a hundred-weight of corn. She passed the night
with them, sleeping with Mrs. Wang, who was at
first rather frightened, but who soon laid aside her
suspicions when she found that the old lady meant so
well towards them. Next day, the latter addressed
Wang, saying, “My grandson, you must not be so lazy.
You should try to make a little money in some way or
other.” Wang replied that he had no capital; upon
which the old lady said, “When your grandfather was
alive, he allowed me to take what money I liked; but not
being a mortal, I had no use for it, and consequently did
not draw largely upon him. I have, however, saved from
my pin-money the sum of forty ounces of silver, which
has long been lying idle for want of an investment.
Take it, and buy summer cloth, which you may carry to
<span class="pagenum" title="i-69"><a id="Page_i-69"></a></span>
the capital and re-sell at a profit.” So Wang bought
some fifty pieces of summer cloth; and the old lady
made him get ready, calculating that in six or seven days
he would reach the capital. She also warned him, saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse_i8"><span class="legacy-indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Be neither lazy nor slow&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">For if a day too long you wait,</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">Repentance comes a day too late.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Wang promised all obedience, and packed up his goods
and went off. On the road he was overtaken by a rain-storm
which soaked him through to the skin; and as he
was not accustomed to be out in bad weather, it was
altogether too much for him. He accordingly sought
shelter in an inn, but the rain went on steadily till night,
running over the eaves of the house like so many ropes.
Next morning the roads were in a horrible state; and
Wang, watching the passers-by slipping about in the
slush, unable to see any path, dared not face it all, and
remained until noon, when it began to dry up a little.
Just then, however, the clouds closed over again, and
down came the rain in torrents, causing him to stay
another night before he could go on. When he was
nearing the capital, he heard to his great joy that summer
cloth was at a premium; and on arrival proceeded at
once to take up his quarters at an inn. There the landlord
said it was a pity he had come so late, as communications
with the south having been only recently
opened, the supply of summer cloth had been small;
and there being a great demand for it among the wealthy
families of the metropolis, its price had gone up to three
times the usual figure. “But,” he added, “two days
<span class="pagenum" title="i-70"><a id="Page_i-70"></a></span>
ago several large consignments arrived, and the price
went down again, so that the late comers have lost their
market.” Poor Wang was thus left in the lurch, and as
every day more summer cloth came in, the value of it
fell in a corresponding ratio. Wang would not part with
his at a loss, and held on for some ten days, when his
expenses for board and lodging were added to his present
distress. The landlord urged him to sell even at
a loss, and turn his attention to something else, which
he ultimately did, losing over ten ounces of silver on his
venture. Next day he rose in the morning to depart,
but on looking in his purse found all his money gone.
He rushed away to tell the landlord, who, however,
could do nothing for him. Some one then advised him
to take out a summons and make the landlord reimburse
him; but he only sighed, and said, “It is my destiny, and
no fault of the landlord’s.” Thereupon the landlord
was very grateful to him, and gave him five ounces of
silver to enable him to go home. He did not care, however,
to face his grandmother empty-handed, and remained
in a very undecided state, until suddenly he
saw a quail-catcher winning heaps of money by fighting
his birds, and selling them at over 100 <i>cash</i> a-piece.
He then determined to lay out his five ounces of silver
in quails, and pay back the landlord out of the profits.
The latter approved very highly of this plan, and not
only agreed to lend him a room but also to charge him
little or nothing for his board. So Wang went off rejoicing,
and bought two large baskets of quails, with
which he returned to the city, to the great satisfaction of
<span class="pagenum" title="i-71"><a id="Page_i-71"></a></span>
the landlord who advised him to lose no time in disposing
of them. All that night it poured in torrents,
and the next morning the streets were like rivers, the
rain still continuing to fall. Wang waited for it to clear
up, but several days passed and still there were no signs
of fine weather. He then went to look at his quails,
some of which he found dead and others dying. He
was much alarmed at this, but was quite at a loss what
to do; and by the next day a lot more had died, so that
only a few were left, which he fed all together in one
basket. The day after this he went again to look at
them, and lo! there remained but a single quail. With
tears in his eyes he told the landlord what had happened,
and he, too, was much affected. Wang then
reflected that he had no money left to carry him home,
and that he could not do better than cease to live. But
the landlord spoke to him and soothed him, and they
went together to look at the quail. “This is a fine
bird,” said the landlord, “and it strikes me that it has
simply killed the others. Now, as you have got nothing
to do, just set to work and train it; and if it is good for
anything, why you’ll be able to make a living out of it.”
Wang did as he was told; and when the bird was
trained, the landlord bade him take it into the street
and gamble for something to eat. This, too, he did, and
his quail won every main; whereupon the landlord gave
him some money to bet with the young fellows of the
neighbourhood. Everything turned out favourably, and
by the end of six months he had saved twenty ounces
of silver, so that he became quite easy in his mind
<span class="pagenum" title="i-72"><a id="Page_i-72"></a></span>
and looked upon the quail as a dispensation of his
destiny.</p>

<p>Now one of the princes was passionately fond of
quail-fighting, and always at the Feast of Lanterns anybody
who owned quails might go and fight them in the
palace against the prince’s birds. The landlord therefore
said to Wang, “Here is a chance of enriching yourself
by a single stroke; only I can’t say what your luck
will do for you.” He then explained to him what it was,
and away they went together, the landlord saying, “If you
lose, burst out into lamentations; but if you are lucky
enough to win, and the prince wishes, as he will, to buy
your bird, don’t consent. If he presses you very much
watch for a nod from me before you agree.” This
settled, they proceeded to the palace where they found
crowds of quail-fighters already on the ground; and then
the prince came forth, heralds proclaiming to the multitude
that any who wished to fight their birds might come
up. Some man at once stepped forward, and the prince
gave orders for the quails to be released; but at the
first strike the stranger’s quail was knocked out of time.
The prince smiled, and by-and-by won several more
mains, until at last the landlord said, “Now’s our time,”
and went up together with Wang. The Prince looked
at their bird and said, “It has a fierce-looking eye and
strong feathers. We must be careful what we are doing.”
So he commanded his servants to bring out Iron Beak
to oppose Wang’s bird; but, after a couple of strikes,
the prince’s quail was signally defeated. He sent for a
better bird, but that shared the same fate; and then he
<span class="pagenum" title="i-73"><a id="Page_i-73"></a></span>
cried out, “Bring the Jade Bird from the palace!” In a
little time it arrived, with pure white feathers like an
egret, and an unusually martial appearance. Wang was
much alarmed, and falling on his knees prayed to be
excused this main, saying, “Your highness’s bird is too
good. I fear lest mine should be wounded, and my
livelihood be taken from me.” But the Prince laughed
and said, “Go on. If your quail is killed I will make
it up to you handsomely.” Wang then released his bird
and the prince’s quail rushed at it at once; but when the
Jade bird was close by, Wang’s quail awaited its coming
head down and full of rage. The former made a
violent peck at its adversary, and then sprung up to
swoop down on it. Thus they went on up and down,
backwards and forwards, until at length they got hold of
each other, and the prince’s bird was beginning to show
signs of exhaustion. This enraged it all the more, and
it fought more violently than ever; but soon a perfect
snowstorm of feathers began to fall, and, with drooping
wings, the Jade bird made its escape. The spectators
were much moved by the result; and the prince himself,
taking up Wang’s bird, examined it closely from beak to
claws, finally asking if it was for sale. “My sole dependence,”
replied Wang, “is upon this bird. I would
rather not part with it.” “But,” said the prince, “if I
give you as much as the capital, say of an ordinary
tradesman, will not that tempt you?” Wang thought
some time, and then answered, “I would rather not sell
my bird; but as your highness has taken a fancy to it I
will only ask enough to find me in food and clothes.”
<span class="pagenum" title="i-74"><a id="Page_i-74"></a></span>
“How much do you want?” inquired the prince; to
which Wang replied that he would take a thousand
ounces of silver. “You fool!” cried the Prince; “do
you think your bird is such a jewel as all that?”
“If your highness,” said Wang, “does not think the
bird a jewel, I value it more than that stone which was
priced at fifteen cities.” “How so?” asked the prince.
“Why,” said Wang, “I take my bird every day into the
market-place. It there wins for me several ounces of
silver, which I exchange for rice; and my family, over
ten in number, has nothing to fear from either cold or
hunger. What jewel could do that?” “You shall not
lose anything,” replied the prince; “I will give you
two hundred ounces.” But Wang would not consent,
and then the prince added another hundred; whereupon
Wang looked at the landlord, who, however, made no
sign. Wang then offered to take nine hundred; but the
prince ridiculed the idea of paying such a price for a
quail, and Wang was preparing to take his leave with the
bird, when the prince called him back, saying, “Here!
here! I will give you six hundred. Take it or leave it
as you please.” Wang here looked at the landlord, and
the landlord remained motionless as before. However,
Wang was satisfied himself with this offer, and being
afraid of missing his chance, said to his friend, “If I
get this price for it I shall be quite content. If we go
on haggling and finally come to no terms, that will be a
very poor end to it all.” So he took the prince’s offer,
and the latter, overjoyed, caused the money to be
handed to him. Wang then returned with his earnings;
<span class="pagenum" title="i-75"><a id="Page_i-75"></a></span>
but the landlord said to him, “What did I say to you?
You were in too much of a hurry to sell. Another
minute, and you would have got eight hundred.” When
Wang got back he threw the money on the table and
told the landlord to take what he liked; but the latter
would not, and it was only after some pressing that he
would accept payment for Wang’s board. Wang then
packed up and went home, where he told his story and
produced his silver to the great delight of all of them.
The old lady counselled the purchase of a quantity of
land, the building of a house, and the purchase of implements;
and in a very short time they became a
wealthy family. The old lady always got up early in the
morning and made Wang attend to the farm, his wife to
her spinning; and rated them soundly at any signs of
laziness. The husband and wife henceforth lived in
peace, and no longer abused each other, until at the expiration
of three years the old lady declared her intention
of bidding them adieu. They both tried to stop
her, and with the aid of tears succeeded in persuading
her; but the next day she had disappeared.<a id="Anchor-85" title="Go to Footnote 85" href="#Footnote-85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

THE PAINTED SKIN.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> T‘ai-yüan there lived a man named Wang. One
morning he was out walking when he met a young lady
carrying a bundle and hurrying along by herself. As
she moved along with some difficulty,<a id="Anchor-86" title="Go to Footnote 86" href="#Footnote-86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Wang quickened
<span class="pagenum" title="i-77"><a id="Page_i-77"></a></span>
his pace and caught her up, and found she was a pretty
girl of about sixteen. Much smitten he inquired
whither she was going so early, and no one with her.
“A traveller like you,” replied the girl, “cannot alleviate
my distress; why trouble yourself to ask?” “What
distress is it?” said Wang; “I’m sure I’ll do anything
I can for you.” “My parents,” answered she, “loved
money, and they sold me as concubine into a rich
family, where the wife was very jealous, and beat and
abused me morning and night. It was more than I
<span class="pagenum" title="i-78"><a id="Page_i-78"></a></span>
could stand, so I have run away.” Wang asked her
where she was going; to which she replied that a runaway
had no fixed place of abode. “My house,” said
Wang, “is at no great distance; what do you say to
coming there?” She joyfully acquiesced; and Wang,
taking up her bundle, led the way to his house. Finding
no one there, she asked Wang where his family were; to
which he replied that that was only the library. “And
a very nice place, too,” said she; “but if you are kind
enough to wish to save my life, you mustn’t let it be
known that I am here.” Wang promised he would
not divulge her secret, and so she remained there for
some days without anyone knowing anything about
it. He then told his wife, and she, fearing the girl
might belong to some influential family, advised him to
send her away. This, however, he would not consent to
do; when one day, going into the town, he met a Taoist
priest, who looked at him in astonishment, and asked
him what he had met. “I have met nothing,” replied
Wang. “Why,” said the priest, “you are bewitched;
what do you mean by not having met anything?” But
Wang insisted that it was so, and the priest walked
away, saying, “The fool! Some people don’t seem
to know when death is at hand.” This startled Wang,
who at first thought of the girl; but then he reflected
that a pretty young thing as she was couldn’t well be a
witch, and began to suspect that the priest merely
wanted to do a stroke of business. When he returned,
the library door was shut, and he couldn’t get in, which
made him suspect that something was wrong; and so he
<span class="pagenum" title="i-79"><a id="Page_i-79"></a></span>
climbed over the wall, where he found the door of the
inner room shut too. Softly creeping up, he looked
through the window and saw a hideous devil, with a
green face and jagged teeth like a saw, spreading a
human skin upon the bed and painting it with a paint-brush.
The devil then threw aside the brush, and
giving the skin a shake out, just as you would a coat,
threw it over its shoulders, when, lo! it was the girl.
Terrified at this, Wang hurried away with his head
down in search of the priest who had gone he knew
not whither; subsequently finding him in the fields,
where he threw himself on his knees and begged the
priest to save him. “As to driving her away,” said the
priest, “the creature must be in great distress to be
seeking a substitute for herself;<a id="Anchor-87" title="Go to Footnote 87" href="#Footnote-87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> besides, I could hardly
endure to injure a living thing.”<a id="Anchor-88" title="Go to Footnote 88" href="#Footnote-88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> However, he gave
<span class="pagenum" title="i-80"><a id="Page_i-80"></a></span>
Wang a fly-brush, and bade him hang it at the door
of the bedroom, agreeing to meet again at the Ch‘ing-ti
temple. Wang went home, but did not dare enter the
library; so he hung up the brush at the bedroom door,
and before long heard a sound of footsteps outside. Not
daring to move, he made his wife peep out; and she saw
the girl standing looking at the brush, afraid to pass
it. She then ground her teeth and went away; but
in a little while came back, and began cursing, saying,
“You priest, you won’t frighten me. Do you think
I am going to give up what is already in my grasp?”
Thereupon, she tore the brush to pieces, and bursting
open the door, walked straight up to the bed, where
she ripped open Wang and tore out his heart, with which
she went away. Wang’s wife screamed out, and the
servant came in with a light; but Wang was already
dead and presented a most miserable spectacle. His
wife, who was in an agony of fright, hardly dared cry
for fear of making a noise; and next day she sent
Wang’s brother to see the priest. The latter got
into a great rage, and cried out, “Was it for this that
I had compassion on you, devil that you are?” proceeding
at once with Wang’s brother to the house, from
which the girl had disappeared without anyone knowing
whither she had gone. But the priest, raising his head,
looked all round, and said, “Luckily she’s not far off.”
He then asked who lived in the apartments on the
south side, to which Wang’s brother replied that he
did; whereupon the priest declared that there she would
be found. Wang’s brother was horribly frightened
<span class="pagenum" title="i-81"><a id="Page_i-81"></a></span>
and said he did not think so; and then the priest asked
him if any stranger had been to the house. To this
he answered that he had been out to the Ch‘ing-ti
temple and couldn’t possibly say; but he went off to
inquire, and in a little while came back and reported
that an old woman had sought service with them as
a maid-of-all-work, and had been engaged by his wife.
“That is she,” said the priest, as Wang’s brother added
she was still there; and they all set out to go to the
house together. Then the priest took his wooden
sword, and standing in the middle of the court-yard,
shouted out, “Base-born fiend, give me back my fly-brush!”
Meanwhile the new maid-of-all-work was in
a great state of alarm, and tried to get away by the
door; but the priest struck her and down she fell flat, the
human skin dropped off, and she became a hideous
devil. There she lay grunting like a pig, until the priest
grasped his wooden sword and struck off her head.
She then became a dense column of smoke curling
up from the ground, when the priest took an uncorked
gourd and threw it right into the midst of the smoke.
A sucking noise was heard, and the whole column
was drawn into the gourd; after which the priest corked
it up closely and put it in his pouch.<a id="Anchor-89" title="Go to Footnote 89" href="#Footnote-89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The skin, too,
which was complete even to the eyebrows, eyes, hands,
and feet, he also rolled up as if it had been a scroll,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-82"><a id="Page_i-82"></a></span>
and was on the point of leaving with it, when Wang’s
wife stopped him, and with tears entreated him to bring
her husband to life. The priest said he was unable to
do that; but Wang’s wife flung herself at his feet, and
with loud lamentations implored his assistance. For
some time he remained immersed in thought, and then
replied, “My power is not equal to what you ask.
I myself cannot raise the dead; but I will direct you
to some one who can, and if you apply to him properly
you will succeed.” Wang’s wife asked the priest who
it was; to which he replied, “There is a maniac
in the town who passes his time grovelling in the dirt.
Go, prostrate yourself before him, and beg him to help
you. If he insults you, shew no sign of anger.” Wang’s
brother knew the man to whom he alluded, and accordingly
bade the priest adieu, and proceeded thither with
his sister-in-law.</p>

<p>They found the destitute creature raving away by
the road side, so filthy that it was all they could do
to go near him. Wang’s wife approached him on
her knees; at which the maniac leered at her, and
cried out, “Do you love me, my beauty?” Wang’s
wife told him what she had come for, but he only
laughed and said, “You can get plenty of other
husbands. Why raise the dead one to life?” But
Wang’s wife entreated him to help her; whereupon
he observed, “It’s very strange: people apply to me
to raise their dead as if I was king of the infernal
regions.” He then gave Wang’s wife a thrashing with
his staff, which she bore without a murmur, and before
<span class="pagenum" title="i-83"><a id="Page_i-83"></a></span>
a gradually increasing crowd of spectators. After this
he produced a loathsome pill which he told her she
must swallow, but here she broke down and was quite
unable to do so. However, she did manage it at last,
and then the maniac crying out, “How you do love
me!” got up and went away without taking any more
notice of her. They followed him into a temple with
loud supplications, but he had disappeared, and every
effort to find him was unsuccessful. Overcome with
rage and shame, Wang’s wife went home, where she
mourned bitterly over her dead husband, grievously
repenting the steps she had taken, and wishing only
to die. She then bethought herself of preparing the
corpse, near which none of the servants would venture;
and set to work to close up the frightful wound of which
he died.</p>

<p>While thus employed, interrupted from time to time
by her sobs, she felt a rising lump in her throat,
which by-and-by came out with a pop and fell straight
into the dead man’s wound. Looking closely at it,
she saw it was a human heart; and then it began as
it were to throb, emitting a warm vapour like smoke.
Much excited, she at once closed the flesh over it,
and held the sides of the wound together with all her
might. Very soon, however, she got tired, and finding
the vapour escaping from the crevices, she tore up a
piece of silk and bound it round, at the same time
bringing back circulation by rubbing the body and
covering it up with clothes. In the night, she removed
the coverings, and found that breath was coming from
<span class="pagenum" title="i-84"><a id="Page_i-84"></a></span>
the nose; and by next morning her husband was alive
again, though disturbed in mind as if awaking from
a dream and feeling a pain in his heart. Where he
had been wounded, there was a cicatrix about as big
as a cash, which soon after disappeared.</p>

<br/>
THE TRADER’S SON.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">In</span> the province of Hunan there dwelt a man who was
engaged in trading abroad; and his wife, who lived
alone, dreamt one night that some one was in her room.
Waking up, she looked about, and discovered a small
creature which on examination she knew to be a fox;
but in a moment the thing had disappeared, although
the door had not been opened. The next evening she
asked the cook-maid to come and keep her company;
as also her own son, a boy of ten, who was accustomed
to sleep elsewhere. Towards the middle of the night,
when the cook and the boy were fast asleep, back came
the fox; and the cook was waked up by hearing her
mistress muttering something as if she had nightmare.
The former then called out, and the fox ran away; but
from that moment the trader’s wife was not quite herself.
When night came she dared not blow out the candle,
and bade her son be sure and not sleep too soundly.
Later on, her son and the old woman having taken a
nap as they leant against the wall, suddenly waked up
and found her gone. They waited some time, but she
did not return, and the cook was too frightened to go
and look after her; so her son took a light, and at
length found her fast asleep in another room. She
didn’t seem aware that anything particular had happened,
but she became queerer and queerer every day,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-86"><a id="Page_i-86"></a></span>
and wouldn’t have either her son or the cook to keep
her company any more. Her son, however, made a
point of running at once into his mother’s room if he
heard any unusual sounds; and though his mother
always abused him for his pains, he paid no attention to
what she said. At the same time, the more people
urged him on to keep a sharp look-out, the more eccentric
were his mother’s ways. One day she played at being
a mason, and piled up stones upon the window-sill, in
spite of all that was said to her; and if anyone took away
a stone, she threw herself on the ground, and cried like a
child, so that nobody <a id="tn_2">dared</a> go near her. In a few days
she had got both windows blocked up and the light
excluded; and then she set to filling up the chinks with
mud. She worked hard all day without minding the
trouble, and when it was finished she smoothed it off
with the kitchen chopper. Everyone who saw her was
disgusted with such antics, and would take no notice of
her. At night her son darkened his lamp, and, with a
knife concealed on his person, sat waiting for his mother
to mutter. As soon as she began he uncovered his
light, and, blocking up the doorway, shouted out at
the top of his voice. Nothing, however, happened, and
he moved from the door a little way, when suddenly out
rushed something like a fox, which was disappearing
through the door, when he made a quick movement and
cut off about two inches of its tail, from which the warm
blood was still dripping as he brought the light to bear
upon it. His mother hereupon cursed and reviled
him, but he pretended not to hear her, regretting only
<span class="pagenum" title="i-87"><a id="Page_i-87"></a></span>
as he went to bed that he hadn’t hit the brute fair. But
he consoled himself by thinking that although he hadn’t
killed it outright, he had done enough to prevent it
coming again. On the morrow he followed the tracks
of blood over the wall and into the garden of a family
named Ho; and that night, to his great joy, the fox did
not reappear. His mother was meanwhile prostrate,
with hardly any life in her, and in the midst of it all his
father came home. The boy told him what had happened,
at which he was much alarmed, and sent for a
doctor to attend his wife; but she only threw the medicine
away, and cursed and swore horribly. So they
secretly mixed the medicine with her tea and soup, and
in a few days she began to get better, to the inexpressible
delight of both her husband and son. One night,
however, her husband woke up and found her gone;
and after searching for her with the aid of his son,
they discovered her sleeping in another room. From
that time she became more eccentric than ever, and was
always being found in strange places, cursing those who
tried to remove her. Her husband was at his wits’ end.
It was no use keeping the door locked, for it opened of
itself at her approach; and he had called in any number
of magicians to exorcise the fox, but without
obtaining the slightest result. One evening her son
concealed himself in the Ho family garden, and lay
down in the long grass with a view to detecting the fox’s
retreat. As the moon rose he heard the sound of voices,
and, pushing aside the grass, saw two people drinking,
with a long-bearded servant pouring out their wine,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-88"><a id="Page_i-88"></a></span>
dressed in an old dark-brown coat. They were whispering
together, and he could not make out what they
said; but by-and-by he heard one of them remark,
“Get some white wine for to-morrow,” and then they
went away, leaving the long-bearded servant alone. The
latter then threw off his coat, and lay down to sleep on
the stones; whereupon the trader’s son eyed him carefully,
and saw that he was like a man in every respect
except that he had a tail. The boy would then have
gone home; but he was afraid the fox might hear him,
and accordingly remained where he was till near dawn,
when he saw the other two come back, one at a time,
and then they all disappeared among the bushes. On
reaching home his father asked him where he had been,
and he replied that he had stopped the night with the
Ho family. He then accompanied his father to the
town, where he saw hanging up at a hat-shop a fox’s
tail, and finally, after much coaxing, succeeded in making
his father buy it for him. While the latter was
engaged in a shop, his son, who was playing about
beside him, availed himself of a moment when his
father was not looking and stole some money from him,
and went off and bought a quantity of white wine, which
he left in charge of the wine-merchant. Now an uncle
of his, who was a sportsman by trade, lived in the city,
and thither he next betook himself. His uncle was out,
but his aunt was there, and inquired after the health of
his mother. “She has been better the last few days,”
replied he; “but she is now very much upset by a rat
having gnawed a dress of hers, and has sent me to ask
<span class="pagenum" title="i-89"><a id="Page_i-89"></a></span>
for some poison.” His aunt opened the cupboard and
gave him about the tenth of an ounce in a piece of
paper, which he thought was very little; so, when his
aunt had gone to get him something to eat, he took the
opportunity of being alone, opened the packet, and abstracted
a large handful. Hiding this in his coat, he ran
to tell his aunt that she needn’t prepare anything for
him, as his father was waiting in the market, and he
couldn’t stop to eat it. He then went off; and having
quietly dropped the poison into the wine he had bought,
went sauntering about the town. At nightfall he returned
home, and told his father that he had been at his
uncle’s. This he continued to do for some time, until
one day he saw amongst the crowd his long-bearded
friend. Marking him closely, he followed him, and at
length entered into conversation, asking him where he
lived. “I live at Pei-ts‘un,” said he; “where do you
live?” “I,” replied the trader’s son, falsely, “live in a
hole on the hill-side.” The long-bearded man was considerably
startled at his answer, but much more so when
he added, “We’ve lived there for generations: haven’t
<em>you?</em>” The other then asked his name, to which the
boy replied, “My name is Hu.<a id="Anchor-90" title="Go to Footnote 90" href="#Footnote-90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> I saw you with two
gentlemen in the Ho family garden, and haven’t forgotten
you.” Questioning him more fully, the long-bearded
man was still in a half-and-half state of belief
and doubt, when the trader’s son opened his coat a little
bit, and showed him the end of the tail he had bought,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-90"><a id="Page_i-90"></a></span>
saying, “The like of us can mix with ordinary people,
but unfortunately we can never get rid of this.” The
long-bearded man then asked him what he was doing
there, to which he answered that his father had sent him
to buy wine; whereupon the former remarked that that was
exactly what he had come for, and the boy then inquired
if he had bought it yet or not. “We are poor,” replied
the stranger, “and as a rule I prefer to steal it.” “A
difficult and dangerous job,” observed the boy. “I have
my master’s instructions to get some,” said the other,
“and what am I to do?” The boy then asked him who
his masters were, to which he replied that they were the
two brothers the boy had seen that night. “One of
them has bewitched a lady named Wang; and the other,
the wife of a trader who lives near. The son of the
last-mentioned lady is a violent fellow, and cut off my
master’s tail, so that he was laid up for ten days. But
he is putting her under spells again now.” He was then
going away, saying he should never get his wine; but
the boy said to him, “It’s much easier to buy than
steal. I have some at the wine-shop there which I
will give to you. My purse isn’t empty, and I can buy
some more.” The long-bearded man hardly knew how
to thank him; but the boy said, “We’re all one family.
Don’t mention such a trifle. When I have time I’ll
come and take a drink with you.” So they went off
together to the wine-shop, where the boy gave him the
wine and they then separated. That night his mother
slept quietly and had no fits, and the boy knew that
something must have happened. He then told his
<span class="pagenum" title="i-91"><a id="Page_i-91"></a></span>
father, and they went to see if there were any results;
when lo! they found both foxes stretched out dead in the
arbour. One of the foxes was lying on the grass, and
out of its mouth blood was still trickling. The wine-bottle
was there; and on shaking it they heard that
some was left. Then his father asked him why he had
kept it all so secret; to which the boy replied that foxes
were very sagacious, and would have been sure to scent
the plot. Thereupon his father was mightily pleased,
and said he was a perfect Ulysses<a id="Anchor-91" title="Go to Footnote 91" href="#Footnote-91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> for cunning. They
then carried the foxes home, and saw on the tail of one
of them the scar of a knife-wound. From that time they
were left in peace; but the trader’s wife became very
thin, and though her reason returned, she shortly afterwards
died of consumption. The other lady, Mrs.
Wang, began to get better as soon as the foxes had been
killed; and as to the boy, he was taught riding and
archery<a id="Anchor-92" title="Go to Footnote 92" href="#Footnote-92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> by his proud parent, and subsequently rose to
high rank in the army.</p>

<br/>
JUDGE LU.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Ling-yang there lived a man named Chu Erh-tan,
whose literary designation<a id="Anchor-93" title="Go to Footnote 93" href="#Footnote-93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> was Hsiao-ming. He
was a fine manly fellow, but an egregious dunce, though
he tried hard to learn. One day he was taking wine
with a number of fellow-students, when one of them
<span class="pagenum" title="i-93"><a id="Page_i-93"></a></span>
said to him, by way of a joke, “People credit you
with plenty of pluck. Now, if you will go in the
middle of the night to the Chamber of Horrors,<a id="Anchor-94" title="Go to Footnote 94" href="#Footnote-94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and
bring back the Infernal Judge from the left-hand porch,
we’ll all stand you a dinner.” For at Ling-yang there
was a representation of the Ten Courts of Purgatory, with
the Gods and devils carved in wood, and almost life-like
in appearance; and in the eastern vestibule there was a
full-length image of the Judge with a green face, and a
red beard, and a hideous expression in his features.
Sometimes sounds of examination under the whip were
heard to issue during the night from both porches, and
persons who went in found their hair standing on end
from fear; so the other young men thought it would
be a capital test for Mr. Chu. Thereupon Chu smiled,
and rising from his seat went straight off to the temple;
and before many minutes had elapsed they heard him
shouting outside, “His Excellency has arrived!” At
this they all got up, and in came Chu with the image
on his back, which he proceeded to deposit on the
table, and then poured out a triple libation in its
<span class="pagenum" title="i-94"><a id="Page_i-94"></a></span>
honour. His comrades who were watching what he
did, felt ill at ease, and did not like to resume their
seats; so they begged him to carry the Judge back again.
But he first poured some wine upon the ground, invoking
the image as follows:&mdash;“I am only a fool-hardy,
illiterate fellow: I pray Your Excellency excuse me. My
house is close by, and whenever Your Excellency feels
so disposed I shall be glad to take a cup of wine with
you in a friendly way.” He then carried the Judge back,
and the next day his friends gave him the promised
dinner, from which he went home half-tipsy in the
evening. But not feeling that he had had enough, he
brightened up his lamp, and helped himself to another
cup of wine, when suddenly the bamboo curtain was
drawn aside, and in walked the Judge. Mr. Chu got
up and said, “Oh, dear! Your Excellency has come to
cut off my head for my rudeness the other night.” The
Judge parted his thick beard, and smiling, replied,
“Nothing of the kind. You kindly invited me last
night to visit you; and as I have leisure this evening,
here I am.” Chu was delighted at this, and made his
guest sit down, while he himself wiped the cups and
lighted a fire.<a id="Anchor-95" title="Go to Footnote 95" href="#Footnote-95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> “It’s warm weather,” said the Judge;
“let’s drink the wine cold.” Chu obeyed, and putting
the bottle on the table, went out to tell his servants to
get some supper. His wife was much alarmed when
she heard who was there, and begged him not to go
<span class="pagenum" title="i-95"><a id="Page_i-95"></a></span>
back; but he only waited until the things were ready,
and then returned with them. They drank out of each
other’s cups,<a id="Anchor-96" title="Go to Footnote 96" href="#Footnote-96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and by-and-by Chu asked the name of his
guest. “My name is Lu,” replied the Judge; “I have
no other names.” They then conversed on literary
subjects, one capping the other’s quotation as echo
responds to sound. The Judge then asked Chu if he
understood composition; to which he answered that he
could just tell good from bad; whereupon the former
repeated a little infernal poetry which was not very
different from that of mortals. He was a deep drinker,
and took off ten goblets at a draught; but Chu who
had been at it all day, soon got dead drunk and fell fast
asleep with his head on the table. When he waked up
the candle had burnt out and day was beginning to
break, his guest having already departed; and from this
time the Judge was in the habit of dropping in pretty
often, until a close friendship sprang up between them.
Sometimes the latter would pass the night at the house,
and Chu would show him his essays, all of which the
Judge scored and underlined as being good for nothing.
One night Chu got tipsy and went to bed first, leaving the
Judge drinking by himself. In his drunken sleep he
seemed to feel a pain in his stomach, and waking up he
saw that the Judge, who was standing by the side of the
bed, had opened him, and was carefully arranging his
inside. “What harm have I done you?” cried Chu,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-96"><a id="Page_i-96"></a></span>
“that you should thus seek to destroy me?” “Don’t
be afraid,” replied the Judge, laughing, “I am only
providing you with a more intelligent heart.”<a id="Anchor-97" title="Go to Footnote 97" href="#Footnote-97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> He then
quietly put back Chu’s viscera, and closed up the
opening, securing it with a bandage tied tightly round
his waist. There was no blood on the bed, and all
Chu felt was a slight numbness in his inside. Here he
observed the Judge place a piece of flesh upon the
table, and asked him what it was. “Your heart,” said
the latter, “which wasn’t at all good at composition,
the proper orifice being stuffed up.<a id="Anchor-98" title="Go to Footnote 98" href="#Footnote-98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> I have now provided
you with a better one, which I procured from
Hades, and I am keeping yours to put in its place.”<a id="Anchor-99" title="Go to Footnote 99" href="#Footnote-99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
He then opened the door and took his leave. In
the morning Chu undid the bandage, and looked at
his waist, the wound on which had quite healed up,
leaving only a red seam. From that moment he
became an apt scholar, and found his memory much
improved; so much so, that a few days afterwards he
showed an essay to the Judge for which he was very
much commended. “However,” said the latter, “your
success will be limited to the master’s degree. You
won’t get beyond that.” “When shall I take it?”
<span class="pagenum" title="i-97"><a id="Page_i-97"></a></span>
asked Chu. “This year,” replied the Judge. And so
it turned out. Chu passed first on the list for the
bachelor’s degree, and then among the first five for the
master’s degree. His old comrades, who had been
accustomed to make a laughing-stock of him, were now
astonished to find him a full blown <abbr title="Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr>, and when
they learned how it had come about, they begged Chu
to speak to the Judge on their behalf. The Judge
promised to assist them, and they made all ready to
receive him; but when in the evening he did come,
they were so frightened at his red beard and flashing
eyes that their teeth chattered in their heads, and one
by one they stole away. Chu then took the Judge
home with him to have a cup together, and when the
wine had mounted well into his head, he said, “I am
deeply grateful to Your Excellency’s former kindness
in arranging my inside; but there is still another favour
I venture to ask which possibly may be granted.” The
Judge asked him what it was; and Chu replied, “If
you can change a person’s inside, you surely could also
change his face. Now my wife is not at all a bad
figure, but she is very ugly. I pray Your Excellency
try the knife upon her.” The Judge laughed, and said
he would do so, only it would be necessary to give
him a little time. Some days subsequently, the Judge
knocked at Chu’s door towards the middle of the night;
whereupon the latter jumped up and invited him in.
Lighting a candle, it was evident that the Judge had
something under his coat, and in answer to Chu’s inquiries,
he said, “It’s what you asked me for. I have
<span class="pagenum" title="i-98"><a id="Page_i-98"></a></span>
had great trouble in procuring it.” He then produced
the head of a nice-looking young girl, and presented
it to Chu, who found the blood on the neck was still
warm. “We must make haste,” said the Judge, “and
take care not to wake the fowls or dogs.”<a id="Anchor-100" title="Go to Footnote 100" href="#Footnote-100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Chu was
afraid his wife’s door might be bolted; but the Judge
laid his hand on it and it opened at once. Chu then
led him to the bed where his wife was lying asleep
on her side; and the Judge, giving Chu the head to
hold, drew from his boot a steel blade shaped like the
handle of a spoon. He laid this across the lady’s
neck, which he cut through as if it had been a melon,
and the head fell over the back of the pillow. Seizing
the head he had brought with him, he now fitted it
on carefully and accurately, and pressing it down to
make it stick, bolstered the lady up with pillows placed on
either side. When all was finished, he bade Chu put
his wife’s old head away, and then took his leave. Soon
after Mrs. Chu waked up, and perceived a curious sensation
about her neck, and a scaly feeling about the
jaws. Putting her hand to her face, she found flakes of
dry blood; and much frightened called a maid-servant
to bring water to wash it off. The maid-servant was
also greatly alarmed at the appearance of her face, and
<span class="pagenum" title="i-99"><a id="Page_i-99"></a></span>
proceeded to wash off the blood, which coloured a
whole basin of water; but when she saw her mistress’s
new face she was almost frightened to death. Mrs.
Chu took a mirror to look at herself, and was staring at
herself in utter astonishment, when her husband came
in and explained what had taken place. On examining
her more closely, Chu saw that she had a well-featured
pleasant face, of a medium order of beauty; and when
he came to look at her neck, he found a red seam all
round, with the parts above and below of a different
coloured flesh. Now the daughter of an official named
Wu was a very nice-looking girl who, though nineteen
years of age, had not yet been married, two gentlemen
who were engaged to her having died before the day.<a id="Anchor-101" title="Go to Footnote 101" href="#Footnote-101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
At the Feast of Lanterns,<a id="Anchor-102" title="Go to Footnote 102" href="#Footnote-102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> this young lady happened
to visit the Chamber of Horrors, whence she
was followed home by a burglar, who that night broke
into the house and killed her. Hearing a noise, her
<span class="pagenum" title="i-100"><a id="Page_i-100"></a></span>
mother told the servant to go and see what was the
matter; and the murder being thus discovered, every
member of the family got up. They placed the body
in the hall, with the head alongside, and gave themselves
up to weeping and wailing the livelong night.
Next morning, when they removed the coverings, the
corpse was there but the head had disappeared. The
waiting-maids were accordingly flogged for neglect of
duty, and consequent loss of the head, and Mr. Wu
brought the matter to the notice of the Prefect. This
officer took very energetic measures, but for three days
no clue could be obtained; and then the story of the
changed head in the Chu family gradually reached
Mr. Wu’s ears. Suspecting something, he sent an old
woman to make inquiries; and she at once recognised
her late young mistress’s features, and went back and
reported to her master. Thereupon Mr. Wu, unable to
make out why the body should have been left, imagined
that Chu had slain his daughter by magical arts, and at
once proceeded to the house to find out the truth of
the matter; but Chu told him that his wife’s head had
been changed in her sleep, and that he knew nothing
about it, adding that it was unjust to accuse him of the
murder. Mr. Wu refused to believe this, and took proceedings
against him; but as all the servants told the
same story, the Prefect was unable to convict him.
Chu returned home and took counsel with the Judge,
who told him there would be no difficulty, it being
merely necessary to make the murdered girl herself
speak. That night Mr. Wu dreamt that his daughter
<span class="pagenum" title="i-101"><a id="Page_i-101"></a></span>
came and said to him, “I was killed by Yang Ta-nien,
of Su-ch‘i. Mr. Chu had nothing to do with it; but
desiring a better-looking face for his wife, Judge Lu
gave him mine, and thus my body is dead while my
head still lives. Bear Chu no malice.” When he
awaked, he told his wife, who had dreamt the same
dream; and thereupon he communicated these facts
to the officials. Subsequently, a man of that name was
captured, who confessed under the bamboo that he had
committed the crime; so Mr. Wu went off to Chu’s
house, and asked to be allowed to see his wife, regarding
Chu from that time as his son-in-law. Mrs.
Chu’s old head was fitted on to the young lady’s body,
and the two parts were buried together.</p>

<p>Subsequent to these events Mr. Chu tried three times
for his doctor’s degree, but each time without success,
and at last he gave up the idea of entering into official
life. Then when thirty years had passed away, Judge
Lu appeared to him one night, and said, “My friend,
you cannot live for ever. Your hour will come in five
days’ time.” Chu asked the Judge if he could not save
him; to which he replied, “The decrees of Heaven
cannot be altered to suit the purposes of mortals.
Besides, to an intelligent man life and death are much
the same.<a id="Anchor-103" title="Go to Footnote 103" href="#Footnote-103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Why necessarily regard life as a boon and
<span class="pagenum" title="i-102"><a id="Page_i-102"></a></span>
death as a misfortune?” Chu could make no reply to
this, and forthwith proceeded to order his coffin and
shroud;<a id="Anchor-104" title="Go to Footnote 104" href="#Footnote-104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and then, dressing himself in his grave-clothes,
yielded up the ghost. Next day, as his wife
was weeping over his bier, in he walked at the front
door, to her very great alarm. “I am now a disembodied
spirit,” said Chu to her, “though not different
from what I was in life; and I have been thinking
much of the widow and orphan I left behind.” His
wife, hearing this, wept till the tears ran down her face,
Chu all the time doing his best to comfort her. “I
have heard tell,” said she, “of dead bodies returning to
life; and since your vital spark is not extinct, why
does it not resume the flesh?” “The ordinances of
Heaven,” replied her husband, “may not be disobeyed.”
His wife here asked him what he was doing in the infernal
regions; and he said that Judge Lu had got him
<span class="pagenum" title="i-103"><a id="Page_i-103"></a></span>
an appointment as Registrar, with a certain rank attached,
and that he was not at all uncomfortable. Mrs.
Chu was proceeding to inquire further, when he interrupted
her, saying, “The Judge has come with me; get
some wine ready and something to eat.” He then
hurried out, and his wife did as he had told her,
hearing them laughing and drinking in the guest
chamber just like old times come back again. About
midnight she peeped in, and found that they had both disappeared;
but they came back once in every two or
three days, often spending the night, and managing the
family affairs as usual. Chu’s son was named Wei, and
was about five years old; and whenever his father came
he would take the little boy upon his knee. When he
was about eight years of age, Chu began to teach him
to read; and the boy was so clever that by the time he
was nine he could actually compose. At fifteen he
took his bachelor’s degree, without knowing all this time
that he had no father. From that date Chu’s visits
became less frequent, occurring not more than once or
so in a month; until one night he told his wife that they
were never to meet again. In reply to her inquiry as
to whither he was going, he said he had been appointed
to a far-off post, where press of business and distance
would combine to prevent him from visiting them any
more. The mother and son clung to him, sobbing
bitterly; but he said, “Do not act thus. The boy is
now a man, and can look after your affairs. The
dearest friends must part some day.” Then, turning
to his son, he added, “Be an honourable man, and
<span class="pagenum" title="i-104"><a id="Page_i-104"></a></span>
take care of the property. Ten years hence we shall
meet again.” With this he bade them farewell, and
went away.</p>

<p>Later on, when Wei was twenty-two years of age, he
took his doctor’s degree, and was appointed to conduct
the sacrifices at the Imperial tombs. On his way
thither he fell in with a retinue of an official, proceeding
along with all the proper insignia,<a id="Anchor-105" title="Go to Footnote 105" href="#Footnote-105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and, looking
carefully at the individual sitting in the carriage, he was
astonished to find that it was his own father. Alighting
from his horse, he prostrated himself with tears at the
side of the road; whereupon his father stopped and
said, “You are well spoken of. I now take leave of
this world.” Wei remained on the ground, not daring
to rise; and his father, urging on his carriage, hurried
away without saying any more. But when he had
gone a short distance, he looked back, and unloosing
a sword from his waist, sent it as a present to
his son, shouting out to him, “Wear this and you
will succeed.” Wei tried to follow him; but, in an
instant, carriage, retinue, and horses, had vanished
with the speed of wind. For a long time his son
gave himself up to grief, and then seizing the sword
began to examine it closely. It was of exquisite
workmanship, and on the blade was engraved this
legend:&mdash;“<i>Be bold, but cautious; round in disposition,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-105"><a id="Page_i-105"></a></span>
square in action.</i>”<a id="Anchor-106" title="Go to Footnote 106" href="#Footnote-106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Wei subsequently rose to high
honours, and had five sons named Ch‘ên, Ch‘ien, Wu,
Hun, and Shên. One night he dreamt that his
father told him to give the sword to Hun, which he
accordingly did; and Hun rose to be a Viceroy of great
administrative ability.</p>

<br/>
MISS YING-NING; OR, THE LAUGHING
GIRL.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Lo-tien, in the province of Shantung, there lived a
youth named Wang Tzŭ-fu, who had been left an
orphan when quite young. He was a clever boy, and
took his bachelor’s degree at the age of fourteen, being
quite his mother’s pet, and not allowed by her to stray
far away from home. One young lady to whom he had
been betrothed having unhappily died, he was still in
search of a wife when, on the occasion of the Feast of
Lanterns, his cousin Wu asked him to come along for a
stroll. But they had hardly got beyond the village
before one of his uncle’s servants caught them up and
told Wu he was wanted. The latter accordingly went
back; but Wang, seeing plenty of nice girls about and
being in high spirits himself, proceeded on alone.
Amongst others, he noticed a young lady with her maid.
She had just picked a sprig of plum-blossom, and
was the prettiest girl he had ever heard of&mdash;a perfect
bunch of smiles. He stared and stared at her quite regardless
of appearances; and when she had passed by,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-107"><a id="Page_i-107"></a></span>
she said to her maid, “That young fellow has a wicked
look in his eyes.” As she was walking away, laughing
and talking, the flower dropped out of her hand; and
Wang, picking it up, stood there disconsolate as if he
had lost his wits. He then went home in a very
melancholy mood; and, putting the flower under his
pillow, lay down to sleep. He would neither talk nor
eat; and his mother became very anxious about him,
and called in the aid of the priests.<a id="Anchor-107" title="Go to Footnote 107" href="#Footnote-107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> By degrees, he
fell off in flesh and got very thin; and the doctor felt
his pulse and gave him medicines to bring out the
disease. Occasionally, he seemed bewildered in his
mind, but in spite of all his mother’s inquiries would
give no clue as to the cause of his malady. One day
when his cousin Wu came to the house, Wang’s mother
told him to try and find out what was the matter; and
the former, approaching the bed, gradually and quietly
led up to the point in question. Wang, who had wept
bitterly at the sight of his cousin, now repeated to him
the whole story, begging him to lend some assistance in
the matter. “How foolish you are, cousin,” cried Wu;
“there will be no difficulty at all, I’ll make inquiries for
you. The girl herself can’t belong to a very aristocratic
family to be walking alone in the country. If she’s not
already engaged, I have no doubt we can arrange the
affair; and even if she is unwilling, an extra outlay will
<span class="pagenum" title="i-108"><a id="Page_i-108"></a></span>
easily bring her round.<a id="Anchor-108" title="Go to Footnote 108" href="#Footnote-108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> You make haste and get well:
I’ll see to it all.” Wang’s features relaxed when he
heard these words; and Wu left him to tell his mother
how the case stood, immediately setting on foot inquiries
as to the whereabouts of the girl. All his efforts,
however, proved fruitless, to the great disappointment of
Wang’s mother; for since his cousin’s visit Wang’s
colour and appetite had returned. In a few days Wu
called again, and in answer to Wang’s questions falsely
told him that the affair was settled. “Who do you think
the young lady is?” said he. “Why, a cousin of ours,
who is only waiting to be betrothed; and though you
two are a little near,<a id="Anchor-109" title="Go to Footnote 109" href="#Footnote-109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> I daresay the circumstances of the
case will be allowed to overrule this objection.” Wang
was overjoyed, and asked where she lived; so Wu had to
tell another lie, and say, “On the south-west hills, about
ten miles from here.” Wang begged him again and
again to do his best for him, and Wu undertook to get
the betrothal satisfactorily arranged. He then took
<span class="pagenum" title="i-109"><a id="Page_i-109"></a></span>
leave of his cousin, who from this moment was rapidly
restored to health. Wang drew the flower from underneath
his pillow, and found that, though dried up, the
leaves had not fallen away. He often sat playing with
this flower and thinking of the young lady; but by-and-by,
as Wu did not reappear, he wrote a letter and asked
him to come. Wu pleaded other engagements, being
unwilling to go; at which Wang got in a rage and quite
lost his good spirits; so that his mother, fearing a relapse,
proposed to him a speedy betrothal in another quarter.
Wang shook his head at this, and sat day after day waiting
for Wu, until his patience was thoroughly exhausted.
He then reflected that ten miles was no great distance,
and that there was no particular reason for asking anybody’s
aid; so, concealing the flower in his sleeve, he
went off in a huff by himself without letting it be known.
Having no opportunity of asking the way, he made
straight for the hills; and after about ten miles walking
found himself right in the midst of them, enjoying their
exquisite verdure, but meeting no one, and with nothing
better than mountain paths to guide him. Away down
in the valley below, almost buried under a densely
luxuriant growth of trees and flowers, he espied a small
hamlet, and began to descend the hill and make his way
thither. He found very few houses, and all built of
rushes, but otherwise pleasant enough to look at. Before
the door of one, which stood at the northern end of the
village, were a number of graceful willow trees, and
inside the wall plenty of peach and apricot trees, with
tufts of bamboo between them, and birds chirping on
<span class="pagenum" title="i-110"><a id="Page_i-110"></a></span>
the branches. As it was a private house he did not
venture to go in, but sat down to rest himself on a huge
smooth stone opposite the front door. By-and-by he
heard a girl’s voice from within calling out Hsiao-jung;
and, noticing that it was a sweet-toned voice, set himself
to listen, when a young lady passed with a bunch of
apricot-flowers in her hand, and occupied in putting hair-pins
into her downcast head. As soon as she raised her
face she saw Wang, and stopped putting in hair-pins;
then, smothering a laugh, picked a few flowers and ran
in. Wang perceived to his intense delight that she was
none other than his heroine of the Feast of Lanterns; but
recollecting that he had no right to follow her in, was on
the point of calling after her as his cousin. There was
no one, however, in the street, and he was afraid lest he
might have made a mistake; neither was there anybody
at the door of whom he could make inquiries. So he
remained there in a very restless state till the sun was
well down in the west, and his hopes were almost at an
end, forgetting all about food and drink. He then saw
the young lady peep through the door, apparently very
much astonished to find him still there; and in a few
minutes out came an old woman leaning on a stick, who
said to him, “Whence do you come, Sir? I hear you
have been here ever since morning. What is it you
want? Aren’t you hungry?” Wang got up, and
making a bow, replied that he was in search of some relatives
of his; but the old woman was deaf and didn’t
catch what he said, so he had to shout it out again at
the top of his voice. She asked him what their names
<span class="pagenum" title="i-111"><a id="Page_i-111"></a></span>
were, but he was unable to tell her; at which she
laughed and said, “It is a funny thing to look for
people when you don’t know their names. I am afraid
you are an unpractical gentleman. You had better
come in and have something to eat; we’ll give you a
bed and you can go back to-morrow and find out the
names of the people you are in quest of.” Now Wang
was just beginning to get hungry, and, besides, this would
bring him nearer to the young lady; so he readily
accepted and followed the old woman in. They walked
along a paved path banked on both sides with hibiscus,
the leaves of which were scattered about on the ground;
and passing through another door, entered a court-yard
full of trained creepers and other flowers. The old
woman showed Wang into a small room with beautifully
white walls and a branch of a crab-apple tree coming
through the window, the furniture being also nice and
clean. They had hardly sat down when it was clear that
some one was taking a peep through the window;
whereupon the old woman cried out, “Hsiao-jung!
make haste and get dinner,” and a maid from outside
immediately answered “Yes, ma’am.” Meanwhile,
Wang had been explaining who he was; and then the
old lady said, “Was your maternal grandfather named
Wu?” “He was,” replied Wang. “Well, I never!”
cried the old woman, “he was my uncle, and your
mother and I are cousins. But in consequence of our
poverty, and having no sons, we have kept quite to ourselves,
and you have grown to be a man without my
knowing you.” “I came here,” said Wang, “about my
<span class="pagenum" title="i-112"><a id="Page_i-112"></a></span>
cousin, but in the hurry I forgot your name.” “My
name is Ch‘in,” replied the old lady; “I have no son:
only a girl, the child of a concubine, who, after my
husband’s death, married again<a id="Anchor-110" title="Go to Footnote 110" href="#Footnote-110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and left her daughter
with me. She’s a clever girl, but has had very little
education; full of fun and ignorant of the sorrows of
life. I’ll send for her by-and-by to make your
acquaintance.” The maid then brought in the dinner&mdash;a
large dish full of choice morsels of fowl&mdash;and the
old woman pressed him to eat. When they had finished,
and the things were taken away, the old woman said,
“Call Miss Ning,” and the maid went off to do so.
After some time there was a giggling at the door, and
the old woman cried out, “Ying-ning! your cousin is
here.” There was then a great tittering as the maid
pushed her in, stopping her mouth all the time to try
and keep from laughing. “Don’t you know better
than to behave like that?” asked the old woman, “and
before a stranger, too.” So Ying-ning controlled her
feelings, and Wang made her a bow, the old woman
saying, “Mr. Wang is your cousin: you have never seen
him before. Isn’t that funny?” Wang asked how old
his cousin was, but the old woman didn’t hear him, and
he had to say it again, which sent Ying-ning off into
another fit of laughter. “I told you,” observed the old
woman, “she hadn’t much education; now you see it.
<span class="pagenum" title="i-113"><a id="Page_i-113"></a></span>
She is sixteen years old, and as foolish as a baby.”
“One year younger than I am,” remarked Wang. “Oh, you’re seventeen
are you? Then you were born in the
year <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, under the sign of the horse.”<a id="Anchor-111" title="Go to Footnote 111" href="#Footnote-111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Wang nodded
assent, and then the old woman asked who his wife was,
to which Wang replied that he had none. “What! a
clever, handsome young fellow of seventeen not yet engaged?<a id="Anchor-112" title="Go to Footnote 112" href="#Footnote-112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
Ying-ning is not engaged either: you two
would make a nice pair if it wasn’t for the relationship.”
Wang said nothing, but looked hard at his cousin; and
just then the maid whispered to her, “It is the fellow
with the wicked eyes! He’s at his old game.” Ying-ning
laughed, and proposed to the maid that they should
go and see if the peaches were in blossom or not; and
off they went together, the former with her sleeve
stuffed into her mouth until she got outside, where she
burst into a hearty fit of laughing. The old woman
gave orders for a bed to be got ready for Wang, saying
to him, “It’s not often we meet: you must spend a few
days with us now you are here, and then we’ll send you
<span class="pagenum" title="i-114"><a id="Page_i-114"></a></span>
home. If you are at all dull, there’s a garden behind
where you can amuse yourself, and books for you to
read.” So next day Wang strolled into the garden,
which was of moderate size, with a well-kept lawn and
plenty of trees and flowers. There was also an arbour
consisting of three posts with a thatched roof, quite shut
in on all sides by the luxurious vegetation. Pushing his
way among the flowers, Wang heard a noise from one
of the trees, and looking up saw Ying-ning, who at once
burst out laughing and nearly fell down. “Don’t!
don’t!” cried Wang, “you’ll fall!” Then Ying-ning
came down, giggling all the time, until, when she was
near the ground, she missed her hold, and tumbled down
with a run. This stopped her merriment, and Wang
picked her up, gently squeezing her hand as he did so.
Ying-ning began laughing again, and was obliged to lean
against a tree for support, it being some time before she
was able to stop. Wang waited till she had finished,
and then drew the flower out of his sleeve and handed
it to her. “It’s dead,” said she; “why do you keep
it?” “You dropped it, cousin, at the Feast of Lanterns,”
replied Wang, “and so I kept it.” She then asked him
what was his object in keeping it, to which he answered,
“To show my love, and that I have not forgotten you.
Since that day when we met, I have been very ill from
thinking so much of you, and am quite changed from
what I was. But now that it is my unexpected good
fortune to meet you, I pray you have pity on me.”
“You needn’t make such a fuss about a trifle,” replied
she, “and with your own relatives, too. I’ll give orders
<span class="pagenum" title="i-115"><a id="Page_i-115"></a></span>
to supply you with a whole basketful of flowers when
you go away.” Wang told her she did not understand,
and when she asked what it was she didn’t understand,
he said, “I didn’t care for the flower itself; it was the
person who picked the flower.” “Of course,” answered
she, “everybody cares for their relations; you needn’t
have told me that.” “I wasn’t talking about ordinary
relations,” said Wang, “but about husbands and wives.”
“What’s the difference?” asked Ying-ning. “Why,”
replied Wang, “husband and wife are always together.”
“Just what I shouldn’t like,” cried she, “to
be always with anybody.”<a id="Anchor-113" title="Go to Footnote 113" href="#Footnote-113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> At this juncture up came
the maid, and Wang slipped quietly away. By-and-by
they all met again in the house, and the old woman
asked Ying-ning where they had been; whereupon she
said they had been talking in the garden. “Dinner has
been ready a long time. I can’t think what you have
had to say all this while,” grumbled the old woman.
“My cousin,” answered Ying-ning, “has been talking to
me about husbands and wives.” Wang was much disconcerted,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-116"><a id="Page_i-116"></a></span>
and made a sign to her to be quiet, so she
smiled and said no more; and the old woman luckily
did not catch her words, and asked her to repeat them.
Wang immediately put her off with something else, and
whispered to Ying-ning that she had done very wrong.
The latter did not see that; and when Wang told her
that what he had said was private, answered him that
she had no secrets from her old mother. “Besides,”
added she, “what harm can there be in talking on such
a common topic as husbands and wives?” Wang was
angry with her for being so dull, but there was no help
for it; and by the time dinner was over he found some
of his mother’s servants had come in search of him,
bringing a couple of donkeys with them. It appeared
that his mother, alarmed at his non-appearance, had
made strict search for him in the village; and when
unable to discover any traces of him, had gone off to
the Wu family to consult. There her nephew, who recollected
what he had previously said to young Wang,
advised that a search should be instituted in the direction
of the hills; and accordingly the servants had been
to all the villages on the way until they had at length recognised
him as he was coming out of the door. Wang
went in and told the old woman, begging that he might
be allowed to take Ying-ning with him. “I have had
the idea in my head for several days,” replied the old
woman, overjoyed; “but I am a feeble old thing myself,
and couldn’t travel so far. If, however, you will take
charge of my girl and introduce her to her aunt, I shall
be very pleased.” So she called Ying-ning, who came
<span class="pagenum" title="i-117"><a id="Page_i-117"></a></span>
up laughing as usual; whereupon the old woman rebuked
her, saying, “What makes you always laugh so?
You would be a very good girl but for that silly habit.
Now, here’s your cousin, who wants to take you away with
him. Make haste and pack up.” The servants who had
come for Wang were then provided with refreshment,
and the old woman bade them both farewell, telling
Ying-ning that her aunt was quite well enough off to
maintain her, and that she had better not come back.
She also advised her not to neglect her studies, and to
be very attentive to her elders, adding that she might
ask her aunt to provide her with a good husband.
Wang and Ying-ning then took their leave; and when
they reached the brow of the hill, they looked back and
could just discern the old woman leaning against the
door and gazing towards the north. On arriving at
Wang’s home, his mother, seeing a nice-looking young
girl with him, asked in astonishment who she might be;
and Wang at once told her the whole story. “But that
was all an invention of your cousin Wu’s,” cried his
mother; “I haven’t got a sister, and consequently I
can’t have such a niece.” Ying-ning here observed, “I
am not the daughter of the old woman; my father was
named Ch‘in and died when I was a little baby, so that
I can’t remember anything.” “I <em>had</em> a sister,” said
Wang’s mother, “who actually did marry a Mr. Ch‘in,
but she died many years ago, and can’t be still living, of
course.” However, on inquiring as to facial appearance
and characteristic marks, Wang’s mother was obliged to
acknowledge the identity, wondering at the same time
<span class="pagenum" title="i-118"><a id="Page_i-118"></a></span>
how her sister could be alive when she had died many
years before. Just then in came Wu, and Ying-ning
retired within; and when he heard the story, remained
some time lost in astonishment, and then said, “Is this
young lady’s name Ying-ning?” Wang replied that it was,
and asked Wu how he came to know it. “Mr. Ch‘in,”
answered he, “after his wife’s death was bewitched by a
fox, and subsequently died. The fox had a daughter
named Ying-ning, as was well known to all the family;
and when Mr. Ch‘in died, as the fox still frequented the
place, the Taoist Pope<a id="Anchor-114" title="Go to Footnote 114" href="#Footnote-114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> was called in to exorcise it. The
fox then went away, taking Ying-ning with it, and now
here she is.” While they were thus discussing, peals of
laughter were heard coming from within, and Mrs. Wang
took occasion to remark what a foolish girl she was.
Wu begged to be introduced, and Mrs. Wang went in to
fetch her, finding her in an uncontrollable fit of
laughter, which she subdued only with great difficulty,
and by turning her face to the wall. By-and-by she
went out; but, after making a bow, ran back and burst
out laughing again to the great discomfiture of all the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-119"><a id="Page_i-119"></a></span>
ladies. Wang then said he would go and find out for
them all about Ying-ning and her queer story, so as to
be able to arrange the marriage; but when he reached
the spot indicated, village and houses had all vanished,
and nothing was to be seen except hill-flowers scattered
about here and there. Wu recollected that Mrs. Ch‘in
had been buried at no great distance from that spot; he
found, however, that the grave had disappeared, and he
was no longer able to determine its position. Not knowing
what to make of it all, he returned home, and then
Mrs. Wang told him she thought the girl must be a disembodied
spirit. Ying-ning shewed no signs of alarm at
this remark; neither did she cry at all when Mrs. Wang
began to condole with her on no longer having a home.
She only laughed in her usual silly way, and fairly
puzzled them all. Sharing Miss Wang’s room, she now
began to take her part in the duties of a daughter of the
family; and as for needlework, they had rarely seen anything
like hers for fineness. But she could not get over
that trick of laughing, which, by the way, never interfered
with her good looks, and consequently rather
amused people than otherwise, amongst others a young
married lady who lived next door. Wang’s mother fixed
an auspicious day for the wedding, but still feeling
suspicious about Ying-ning, was always secretly watching
her. Finding, however, that she had a proper shadow,<a id="Anchor-115" title="Go to Footnote 115" href="#Footnote-115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
<span class="pagenum" title="i-120"><a id="Page_i-120"></a></span>
and that there was nothing extraordinary in her behaviour,
she had her dressed up when the day came, in
all the finery of a bride; and would have made her perform
the usual ceremonies, only Ying-ning laughed so
much she was unable to kneel down.<a id="Anchor-116" title="Go to Footnote 116" href="#Footnote-116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> They were
accordingly obliged to excuse her, but Wang began to
fear that such a foolish girl would never be able to keep
the family counsel. Luckily, she was very reticent and
did not indulge in gossip; and moreover, when Mrs.
Wang was in trouble or out of temper, Ying-ning could
always bring her round with a laugh. The maid-servants,
too, if they expected a whipping for anything, would
always ask her to be present when they appeared before
their mistress, and thus they often escaped punishment.
Ying-ning had a perfect passion for flowers. She got all
she could out of her relations, and even secretly pawned
her jewels to buy rare specimens; and by the end of a
few months the whole place was one mass of flowers.
Behind the house there was one especial tree<a id="Anchor-117" title="Go to Footnote 117" href="#Footnote-117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> which
belonged to the neighbours on that side; but Ying-ning
was always climbing up and picking the flowers, for
which Mrs. Wang rebuked her severely, though without
any result. One day the owner saw her, and gazed at
her some time in rapt astonishment; however, she didn’t
<span class="pagenum" title="i-121"><a id="Page_i-121"></a></span>
move, deigning only to laugh. The gentleman was
much smitten with her; and when she smilingly descended
the wall on her own side, pointing all the time
with her finger to a spot hard by, he thought she was
making an assignation. So he presented himself at
nightfall at the same place, and sure enough Ying-ning
was there. Seizing her hand, to tell his passion, he
found that he was grasping only a log of wood which
stood against the wall; and the next thing he knew was
that a scorpion had stung him violently on the finger.
There was an end of his romance, except that he died
of the wound during the night, and his family at once
commenced an action against Wang for having a witch-wife.
The magistrate happened to be a great admirer
of Wang’s talent, and knew him to be an accomplished
scholar; he therefore refused to grant the summons, and
ordered the prosecutor to be bambooed for false accusation.<a id="Anchor-118" title="Go to Footnote 118" href="#Footnote-118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
Wang interposed and got him off this punishment,
and returned home himself. His mother then
scolded Ying-ning well, saying, “I knew your too
playful disposition would some day bring sorrow upon
you. But for our intelligent magistrate we should have
been in a nice mess. Any ordinary hawk-like official
would have had you publicly interrogated in court; and
then how could your husband ever have held up his
head again?” Ying-ning looked grave and did not
laugh this time; and Mrs. Wang continued, “There’s no
<span class="pagenum" title="i-122"><a id="Page_i-122"></a></span>
harm in laughing as long as it is seasonable laughter;”
but from that moment Ying-ning laughed no more, no
matter what people did to make her, though at the same
time her expression was by no means gloomy. One
evening she went in tears to her husband, who wanted to
know what was the matter. “I couldn’t tell you before,”
said she, sobbing; “we had known each other such a
short time. But now that you and your mother have
been so kind to me, I will keep nothing from you, but
tell you all. I am the daughter of a fox. When my
mother went away she put me in the charge of the disembodied
spirit of an old woman, with whom I remained
for a period of over ten years. I have no brothers:
only you to whom I can look. And now my foster-mother
is lying on the hill-side with no one to bury her
and appease her discontented shade. If not too much,
I would ask you to do this, that her spirit may be at rest,
and know that it was not neglected by her whom she
brought up.” Wang consented, but said he feared they
would not be able to find her grave; on which Ying-ning
said there was no danger of that, and accordingly they
set forth together. When they arrived, Ying-ning
pointed out the tomb in a lonely spot amidst a
thicket of brambles, and there they found the old
woman’s bones. Ying-ning wept bitterly, and then they
proceeded to carry her remains home with them, subsequently
interring them in the Ch‘in family vault. That
night Wang dreamt that the old woman came to thank
him, and when he waked he told Ying-ning, who said
that she had seen her also, and had been warned by her
<span class="pagenum" title="i-123"><a id="Page_i-123"></a></span>
not to frighten Mr. Wang. Her husband asked why she
had not detained the old lady; but Ying-ning replied,
“She is a disembodied spirit, and would be ill at ease for
any time surrounded by so much life.”<a id="Anchor-119" title="Go to Footnote 119" href="#Footnote-119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Wang then
enquired after Hsiao-jung, and his wife said, “She was a
fox too, and a very clever one. My foster-mother kept
her to wait on me, and she was always getting fruit and
cakes for me, so that I have a friendship for her and
shall never forget her. My foster-mother told me
yesterday she was married.”</p>

<p>After this, whenever the great fast-day<a id="Anchor-120" title="Go to Footnote 120" href="#Footnote-120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> came round,
husband and wife went off without fail to worship at the
Ch‘in family tomb; and by the time a year had passed
she gave birth to a son, who wasn’t a bit afraid of
strangers, but laughed at everybody, and in fact took
very much after his mother.</p>

<br/>
THE MAGIC SWORD.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Ning Lai-ch‘ên</span> was a Chekiang man, and a good-natured,
honourable fellow, fond of telling people that
he had only loved once. Happening to go to Chinhua,
he took shelter in a temple to the north of the
city; very nice as far as ornamentation went, but
overgrown with grass taller than a man’s head, and
evidently not much frequented. On either side were
the priest’s apartments, the doors of which were ajar,
with the exception of a small room on the south side,
where the lock had a new appearance. In the east
corner he espied a group of bamboos, growing over
a large pool of water-lilies in flower; and, being much
pleased with the quiet of the place, determined to
remain; more especially as, the Grand Examiner being
in the town, all lodgings had gone up in price. So
he roamed about waiting till the priests should return;
and in the evening, a gentleman came and opened
the door on the south side. Ning quickly made up
to him, and with a bow informed him of his design.
“There is no one here whose permission you need
ask,” replied the stranger; “I am only lodging here,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-125"><a id="Page_i-125"></a></span>
and if you don’t object to the loneliness, I shall be
very pleased to have the benefit of your society.” Ning
was delighted, and made himself a straw bed, and put
up a board for a table, as if he intended to remain some
time; and that night, by the beams of the clear bright
moon, they sat together in the verandah and talked.
The stranger’s name was Yen Ch‘ih-hsia, and Ning
thought he was a student up for the provincial examination,
only his dialect was not that of a Chekiang man.
On being asked, he said he came from Shensi; and
there was an air of straightforwardness about all his
remarks. By-and-by, when their conversation was
exhausted, they bade each other good night and went
to bed; but Ning, being in a strange place, was quite
unable to sleep; and soon he heard sounds of voices
from the room on the north side. Getting up, he
peeped through a window, and saw, in a small court-yard
the other side of a low wall, a woman of about
forty with an old maid-servant in a long faded gown,
humped-backed and feeble-looking. They were chatting
by the light of the moon; and the mistress said, “Why
doesn’t Hsiao-ch‘ien come?” “She ought to be here
by now,” replied the other. “She isn’t offended with
you; is she?” asked the lady. “Not that I know of,”
answered the old servant; “but she seems to want
to give trouble.” “Such people don’t deserve to be
treated well,” said the other; and she had hardly
uttered these words when up came a young girl of
seventeen or eighteen, and very nice looking. The
old servant laughed, and said, “Don’t talk of people
<span class="pagenum" title="i-126"><a id="Page_i-126"></a></span>
behind their backs. We were just mentioning you
as you came without our hearing you; but fortunately
we were saying nothing bad about you. And, as far
as that goes,” added she, “if I were a young fellow
why I should certainly fall in love with you.” “If <em>you</em>
don’t praise me,” replied the girl, “I’m sure I don’t
know who will;” and then the lady and the girl said
something together, and Mr. Ning, thinking they were
the family next door, turned round to sleep without
paying further attention to them. In a little while
no sound was to be heard; but, as he was dropping
off to sleep, he perceived that somebody was in the
room. Jumping up in great haste, he found it was
the young lady he had just seen; and detecting at
once that she was going to attempt to bewitch him,
sternly bade her begone. She then produced a lump of
gold which he threw away, and told her to go after it or
he would call his friend. So she had no alternative
but to go, muttering something about his heart being
like iron or stone. Next day, a young candidate for
the examination came and lodged in the east room
with his servant. He, however, was killed that very
night, and his servant the night after; the corpses of
both shewing a small hole in the sole of the foot as if
bored by an awl, and from which a little blood came. No
one knew who had committed these murders, and when
Mr. Yen came home, Ning asked him what he thought
about it. Yen replied that it was the work of devils,
but Ning was a brave fellow, and that didn’t frighten
him much. In the middle of the night Hsiao-ch‘ien
<span class="pagenum" title="i-127"><a id="Page_i-127"></a></span>
appeared to him again, and said, “I have seen many
men, but none with a steel cold heart like yours. You
are an upright man, and I will not attempt to deceive
you. I, Hsiao-ch‘ien, whose family name is Nieh,
died when only eighteen, and was buried alongside
of this temple. A devil then took possession of me,
and employed me to bewitch people by my beauty,
contrary to my inclination. There is now nothing left
in this temple to slay, and I fear that imps will be
employed to kill you.” Ning was very frightened at
this, and asked her what he should do. “Sleep in
the same room with Mr. Yen,” replied she. “What!”
asked he, “cannot the spirits trouble Yen?” “He is
a strange man,” she answered, “and they don’t like
going near him.” Ning then inquired how the spirits
worked. “I bewitch people,” said Hsiao-ch‘ien, “and
then they bore a hole in the foot which renders the
victim senseless, and proceed to draw off the blood,
which the devils drink. Another method is to tempt
people by false gold, the bones of some horrid demon;
and if they receive it, their hearts and livers will be torn
out. Either method is used according to circumstances.”
Ning thanked her, and asked when he ought to be
prepared; to which she replied, “To-morrow night.”
At parting she wept, and said, “I am about to sink
into the great sea, with no friendly shore at hand. But
your sense of duty is boundless, and you can save
me. If you will collect my bones and bury them in
some quiet spot, I shall not again be subject to these
misfortunes.” Ning said he would do so, and asked
<span class="pagenum" title="i-128"><a id="Page_i-128"></a></span>
where she lay buried. “At the foot of the aspen-tree
on which there is a bird’s nest,” replied she; and
passing out of the door, disappeared. The next day
Ning was afraid that Yen might be going away somewhere,
and went over early to invite him across. Wine
and food were produced towards noon; and Ning,
who took care not to lose sight of Yen, then asked
him to remain there for the night. Yen declined, on
the ground that he liked being by himself; but Ning
wouldn’t hear any excuses, and carried all Yen’s things
to his own room, so that he had no alternative but to
consent. However, he warned Ning, saying, “I know
you are a gentleman and a man of honour. If you
see anything you don’t quite understand, I pray you
not to be too inquisitive; don’t pry into my boxes,
or it may be the worse for both of us.” Ning promised
to attend to what he said, and by-and-by they both
lay down to sleep; and Yen, having placed his boxes
on the window-sill, was soon snoring loudly. Ning
himself could not sleep; and after some time he saw
a figure moving stealthily outside, at length approaching
the window to peep through. It’s eyes flashed like
lightning, and Ning in a terrible fright was just upon the
point of calling Yen, when something flew out of one
of the boxes like a strip of white silk, and dashing
against the window-sill returned at once to the box,
disappearing very much like lightning. Yen heard the
noise and got up, Ning all the time pretending to be
asleep in order to watch what happened. The former
then opened the box, and took out something which
<span class="pagenum" title="i-129"><a id="Page_i-129"></a></span>
he smelt and examined by the light of the moon. It
was dazzlingly white like crystal, and about two inches
in length by the width of an onion leaf in breadth.
He then wrapped it up carefully and put it back in
the broken box, saying, “A bold-faced devil that, to
come so near my box;” upon which he went back to
bed; but Ning, who was lost in astonishment, arose and
asked him what it all meant, telling at the same time
what he himself had seen. “As you and I are good
friends,” replied Yen, “I won’t make any secret of it.
The fact is I am a Taoist priest. But for the window-sill
the devil would have been killed; as it is, he is badly
wounded.” Ning asked him what it was he had there
wrapped up, and he told him it was his sword,<a id="Anchor-121" title="Go to Footnote 121" href="#Footnote-121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> on which
he had smelt the presence of the devil. At Ning’s
request he produced the weapon, a bright little miniature
of a sword; and from that time Ning held his friend in
higher esteem than ever.</p>

<p>Next day he found traces of blood outside the window
which led round to the north of the temple; and there
among a number of graves he discovered the aspen-tree
with the bird’s nest at its summit. He then fulfilled
his promise and prepared to go home, Yen giving him
a farewell banquet, and presenting him with an old
leather case which he said contained a sword, and
would keep at a distance from him all devils and bogies.
Ning then wished to learn a little of Yen’s art; but
<span class="pagenum" title="i-130"><a id="Page_i-130"></a></span>
the latter replied that although he might accomplish
this easily enough, being as he was an upright man,
yet he was well off in life, and not in a condition where
it would be of any advantage to him. Ning then
pretending he had to go and bury his sister, collected
Hsiao-ch‘ien’s bones, and, having wrapped them up
in grave-clothes, hired a boat, and set off on his way
home. On his arrival, as his library looked towards
the open country, he made a grave hard by and buried
the bones there, sacrificing, and invoking Hsiao-ch‘ien as
follows:&mdash;“In pity for your lonely ghost, I have placed
your remains near my humble cottage, where we shall
be near each other, and no devil will dare annoy you.
I pray you reject not my sacrifice, poor though it
be.” After this, he was proceeding home when he
suddenly heard himself addressed from behind, the
voice asking him not to hurry; and turning round
he beheld Hsiao-ch‘ien, who thanked him, saying, “Were
I to die ten times for you I could not discharge my
debt. Let me go home with you and wait upon your
father and mother; you will not repent it.” Looking
closely at her, he observed that she had a beautiful
complexion, and feet as small as bamboo shoots,<a id="Anchor-122" title="Go to Footnote 122" href="#Footnote-122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> being
altogether much prettier now that he came to see her
by daylight. So they went together to his home, and
bidding her wait awhile, Ning ran in to tell his mother,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-131"><a id="Page_i-131"></a></span>
to the very great surprise of the old lady. Now Ning’s
wife had been ill for a long time, and his mother advised
him not to say a word about it to her for fear of frightening
her; in the middle of which in rushed Hsiao-ch‘ien,
and threw herself on the ground before them. “This
is the young lady,” said Ning; whereupon his mother
in some alarm turned her attention to Hsiao-ch‘ien,
who cried out, “A lonely orphan, without brother or
sister, the object of your son’s kindness and compassion,
begs to be allowed to give her poor services as some
return for favours shewn.” Ning’s mother, seeing that
she was a nice pleasant-looking girl, began to lose
fear of her, and replied, “Madam, the preference you
shew for my son is highly pleasing to an old body like
myself; but this is the only hope of our family, and
I hardly dare agree to his taking a devil-wife.” “I have
but one motive in what I ask,” answered Hsiao-ch‘ien,
“and if you have no faith in disembodied people, then
let me regard him as my brother, and live under your
protection, serving you like a daughter.” Ning’s
mother could not resist her straightforward manner, and
Hsiao-ch‘ien asked to be allowed to see Ning’s wife, but
this was denied on the plea that the lady was ill.
Hsiao-ch‘ien then went into the kitchen and got ready
the dinner, running about the place as if she had
lived there all her life. Ning’s mother was, however,
much afraid of her, and would not let her sleep in the
house; so Hsiao-ch‘ien went to the library, and was
just entering when suddenly she fell back a few steps, and
began walking hurriedly backwards and forwards in front
<span class="pagenum" title="i-132"><a id="Page_i-132"></a></span>
of the door. Ning seeing this, called out and asked
her what it meant; to which she replied, “The presence
of that sword frightens me, and that is why I could
not accompany you on your way home.” Ning at
once understood her, and hung up the sword-case in
another place; whereupon she entered, lighted a candle,
and sat down. For some time she did not speak: at
length asking Ning if he studied at night or not&mdash;“For,”
said she, “when I was little I used to repeat the Lêng-yen
<i>sutra;</i> but now I have forgotten more than half,
and, therefore, I should like to borrow a copy, and
when you are at leisure in the evening you might hear
me.” Ning said he would, and they sat silently there
for some time, after which Hsiao-ch‘ien went away
and took up her quarters elsewhere. Morning and
night she waited on Ning’s mother, bringing water
for her to wash in, occupying herself with household
matters, and endeavouring to please her in every way.
In the evening before she went to bed, she would always
go in and repeat a little of the <i>sutra</i>, and leave as soon
as she thought Ning was getting sleepy. Now the
illness of Ning’s wife had given his mother a great
deal of extra trouble&mdash;more, in fact, than she was equal
to; but ever since Hsiao-ch‘ien’s arrival all this was
changed, and Ning’s mother felt kindly disposed to
the girl in consequence, gradually growing to regard
her almost as her own child, and forgetting quite
that she was a spirit. Accordingly, she didn’t make
her leave the house at night; and Hsiao-ch‘ien, who
being a devil had not tasted meat or drink since her
<span class="pagenum" title="i-133"><a id="Page_i-133"></a></span>
arrival,<a id="Anchor-123" title="Go to Footnote 123" href="#Footnote-123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> now began at the end of six months to take
a little thin gruel. Mother and son alike became
very fond of her, and henceforth never mentioned what
she really was; neither were strangers able to detect the
fact. By-and-by, Ning’s wife died, and his mother
secretly wished him to espouse Hsiao-ch‘ien, though she
rather dreaded any unfortunate consequences that might
arise. This Hsiao-ch‘ien perceived, and seizing an
opportunity said to Ning’s mother, “I have been with
you now more than a year, and you ought to know something
of my disposition. Because I was unwilling to
injure travellers I followed your son hither. There
was no other motive; and, as your son has shewn himself
one of the best of men, I would now remain with
him for three years in order that he may obtain for me
some mark of Imperial approbation<a id="Anchor-124" title="Go to Footnote 124" href="#Footnote-124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> which will do
me honour in the realms below.” Ning’s mother knew
that she meant no evil, but hesitated to put the family
hopes of a posterity into jeopardy. Hsiao-ch‘ien, however,
reassured her by saying that Ning would have three
sons, and that the line would not be interrupted by
his marrying her. On the strength of this the marriage
was arranged to the great joy of Ning, a feast prepared,
and friends and relatives invited; and when in response
<span class="pagenum" title="i-134"><a id="Page_i-134"></a></span>
to a call the bride herself came forth in her gay
wedding-dress, the beholders took her rather for a fairy
than for a devil. After this, numbers of congratulatory
presents were given by the various female members
of the family, who vied with one another in making
her acquaintance; and these Hsiao-ch‘ien returned by
gifts of paintings of flowers, done by herself, in which
she was very skilful, the receivers being extremely
proud of such marks of her friendship. One day she
was leaning at the window in a despondent mood,
when suddenly she asked where the sword-case was.
“Oh,” replied Ning, “as you seemed afraid of it, I
moved it elsewhere.” “I have now been so long under
the influence of surrounding life,”<a id="Anchor-125" title="Go to Footnote 125" href="#Footnote-125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> said Hsiao-ch‘ien,
“that I shan’t be afraid of it any more. Let us hang
it on the bed.” “Why so?” asked Ning. “For the last
three days,” explained she, “I have been much agitated
in mind; and I fear that the devil at the temple, angry at
my escape, may come suddenly and carry me off.” So
Ning brought the sword-case, and Hsiao-ch‘ien, after
examining it closely, remarked, “This is where the
magician puts people. I wonder how many were slain
before it got old and worn out as it is now. Even now
when I look at it my flesh creeps.” The case was then
hung up, and next day removed to over the door.
At night they sat up and watched, Hsiao-ch‘ien warning
Ning not to go to sleep; and suddenly something fell
<span class="pagenum" title="i-135"><a id="Page_i-135"></a></span>
down flop like a bird. Hsiao-ch‘ien in a fright got
behind the curtain; but Ning looked at the thing, and
found it was an imp of darkness, with glaring eyes and
a bloody mouth, coming straight to the door. Stealthily
creeping up it made a grab at the sword-case, and
seemed about to tear it in pieces, when bang!&mdash;the
sword-case became as big as a wardrobe, and from it
a devil protruded part of his body and dragged the imp
in. Nothing more was heard, and the sword-case
resumed its original size. Ning was greatly alarmed,
but Hsiao-ch‘ien came out rejoicing, and said, “There’s
an end of my troubles.” In the sword-case they found
only a few quarts of clear water; nothing else.</p>

<p>After these events Ning took his doctor’s degree and
Hsiao-ch‘ien bore him a son. He then took a concubine,
and had one more son by each, all of whom became in
time distinguished men.</p>

THE <i>SHUI-MANG</i> PLANT.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">The</span> <i>shui-mang</i><a id="Anchor-126" title="Go to Footnote 126" href="#Footnote-126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> is a poisonous herb. It is a creeper,
like the bean, and has a similar red flower. Those who
eat of it die, and become <i>shui-mang</i> devils, tradition
asserting that such devils are unable to be born again
unless they can find some one else who has also eaten of
this poison to take their place.<a id="Anchor-127" title="Go to Footnote 127" href="#Footnote-127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> These <i>shui-mang</i> devils
abound in the province of Hunan, where, by the way,
the phrase “same-year man” is applied to those born in
the same year, who exchange visits and call each other
brother, their children addressing the father’s “brother”
as uncle. This has now become a regular custom
there.<a id="Anchor-128" title="Go to Footnote 128" href="#Footnote-128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>A young man named Chu was on his way to visit a
same-year friend of his, when he was overtaken by a
violent thirst. Suddenly he came upon an old woman
sitting by the roadside under a shed and distributing tea
<span class="pagenum" title="i-137"><a id="Page_i-137"></a></span>
gratis,<a id="Anchor-129" title="Go to Footnote 129" href="#Footnote-129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and immediately walked up to her to get a drink.
She invited him into the shed, and presented him with a
bowl of tea in a very cordial spirit; but the smell of it
did not seem like the smell of ordinary tea, and he
would not drink it, rising up to go away. The old woman
stopped him, and called out, “San-niang! bring some
good tea.” Immediately a young girl came from behind
the shed, carrying in her hands a pot of tea. She was
about fourteen or fifteen years old, and of very fascinating
appearance, with glittering rings and bracelets on
her fingers and arms. As Chu received the cup from
her his reason fled; and drinking down the tea she gave
him, the flavour of which was unlike any other kind, he
proceeded to ask for more. Then, watching for a moment
when the old woman’s back was turned, he seized
her wrist and drew a ring from her finger. The girl
blushed and smiled; and Chu, more and more inflamed,
asked her where she lived. “Come again this evening,”
replied she, “and you’ll find me here.” Chu begged
for a handful of her tea, which he stowed away with the
ring, and took his leave. Arriving at his destination, he
felt a pain in his heart, which he at once attributed to
<span class="pagenum" title="i-138"><a id="Page_i-138"></a></span>
the tea, telling his friend what had occurred. “Alas!
you are undone,” cried the other; “they were <i>shui-mang</i>
devils. My father died in the same way, and we were
unable to save him. There is no help for you.” Chu
was terribly frightened, and produced the handful of tea,
which his friend at once pronounced to be leaves of
the <i>shui-mang</i> plant. He then shewed him the ring,
and told him what the girl had said; whereupon his
friend, after some reflection, said, “She must be San-niang,
of the K‘ou family.” “How could you know her
name?” asked Chu, hearing his friend use the same
words as the old woman. “Oh,” replied he, “there was
a nice-looking girl of that name who died some years
ago from eating of the same herb. She is doubtless the
girl you saw.” Here some one observed that if the
person so entrapped by a devil only knew its name, and
could procure an old pair of its shoes, he might save
himself by boiling them in water and drinking the
liquor as medicine. Chu’s friend thereupon rushed off
at once to the K‘ou family, and implored them to give
him an old pair of their daughter’s shoes; but they, not
wishing to prevent their daughter from finding a substitute
in Chu, flatly refused his request. So he went back
in anger and told Chu, who ground his teeth with rage,
saying, “If I die, she shall not obtain her transmigration
thereby.” His friend then sent him home; and
just as he reached the door he fell down dead. Chu’s
mother wept bitterly over his corpse, which was in due
course interred; and he left behind one little boy barely
a year old. His wife did not remain a widow, but in six
<span class="pagenum" title="i-139"><a id="Page_i-139"></a></span>
months married again and went away, putting Chu’s son
under the care of his grandmother, who was quite unequal
to any toil, and did nothing but weep morning
and night. One day she was carrying her grandson
about in her arms, crying bitterly all the time, when
suddenly in walked Chu. His mother, much alarmed,
brushed away her tears, and asked him what it meant.
“Mother,” replied he, “down in the realms below I
heard you weeping. I am therefore come to tend you.
Although a departed spirit, I have a wife, who has likewise
come to share your toil. Therefore do not grieve.”
His mother inquired who his wife was, to which he replied,
“When the K‘ou family sat still and left me to my
fate I was greatly incensed against them; and after
death I sought for San-niang, not knowing where she
was. I have recently seen my old same-year friend, and
he told me where she was. She had come to life again
in the person of the baby-daughter of a high official
named Jen; but I went thither and dragged her spirit
back. She is now my wife, and we get on extremely
well together.” A very pretty and well-dressed young
lady here entered, and made obeisance to Chu’s mother,
Chu saying, “This is San-niang, of the K‘ou family;”
and although not a living being, Mrs. Chu at once took
a great fancy to her. Chu sent her off to help in the
work of the house, and, in spite of not being accustomed
to this sort of thing, she was so obedient to her
mother-in-law as to excite the compassion of all. The
two then took up their quarters in Chu’s old apartments,
and there they continued to remain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="i-140"><a id="Page_i-140"></a></span>
Meanwhile San-niang asked Chu’s mother to let the
K‘ou family know; and this she did, notwithstanding
some objections raised by her son. Mr. and Mrs. K‘ou
were much astonished at the news, and, ordering their
carriage, proceeded at once to Chu’s house. There
they found their daughter, and parents and child fell
into each other’s arms. San-niang entreated them to dry
their tears; but her mother, noticing the poverty of
Chu’s household, was unable to restrain her feelings.
“We are already spirits,” cried San-niang; “what matters
poverty to us? Besides, I am very well treated
here, and am altogether as happy as I can be.” They
then asked her who the old woman was; to which she
replied, “Her name was Ni. She was mortified at being
too ugly to entrap people herself, and got me to assist
her. She has now been born again at a soy-shop in the
city.” Then, looking at her husband, she added,
“Come, since you are the son-in-law, pay the proper
respect to my father and mother, or what shall I think of
you?” Chu made his obeisance, and San-niang went
into the kitchen to get food ready for them, at which her
mother became very melancholy, and went away home,
whence she sent a couple of maid-servants, a hundred
ounces of silver, and rolls of cloth and silk, besides
making occasional presents of food and wine, so that
Chu’s mother lived in comparative comfort. San-niang
also went from time to time to see her parents, but
would never stay very long, pleading that she was
wanted at home, and such excuses; and if the old
people attempted to keep her, she simply went off by
<span class="pagenum" title="i-141"><a id="Page_i-141"></a></span>
herself. Her father built a nice house for Chu with all
kinds of luxuries in it; but Chu never once entered his
father-in-law’s door.</p>

<p>Subsequently a man of the village who had eaten
<i>shui-mang</i>, and had died in consequence, came back to
life, to the great astonishment of everybody. However,
Chu explained it, saying, “I brought him back to life.
He was the victim of a man named Li Chiu; but I
drove off Li’s spirit when it came to make the other
take his place.” Chu’s mother then asked her son why
he did not get a substitute for himself; to which he
replied, “I do not like to do this. I am anxious to put
an end to, rather than take advantage of, such a system.
Besides, I am very happy waiting on you, and have no
wish to be born again.” From that time all persons who
had poisoned themselves with <i>shui-mang</i> were in the
habit of feasting Chu and obtaining his assistance in
their trouble. But in ten years’ time his mother died,
and he and his wife gave themselves up to sorrow, and
would see no one, bidding their little boy put on mourning,
beat his breast, and perform the proper ceremonies.
Two years after Chu had buried his mother, his son
married the granddaughter of a high official named Jen.
This gentleman had had a daughter by a concubine,
who had died when only a few months old; and now,
hearing the strange story of Chu’s wife, came to call on
her and arrange the marriage. He then gave his granddaughter
to Chu’s son, and a free intercourse was maintained
between the two families. However, one day
Chu said to his son, “Because I have been of service to
<span class="pagenum" title="i-142"><a id="Page_i-142"></a></span>
my generation, God has appointed me Keeper of the
Dragons; and I am now about to proceed to my post.”
Thereupon four horses appeared in the court-yard,
drawing a carriage with yellow hangings, the flanks of
the horses being covered with scale-like trappings.
Husband and wife came forth in full dress, and took
their seats, and, while son and daughter-in-law were
weeping their adieus, disappeared from view. That
very day the K‘ou family saw their daughter arrive,
and, bidding them farewell, she told them the same
story. The old people would have kept her, but she
said, “My husband is already on his way,” and, leaving
the house, parted from them for ever. Chu’s son was
named Ngo, and his literary name was Li-ch‘ên. He
begged San-niang’s bones from the K‘ou family, and
buried them by the side of his father’s.</p>

<br/>
LITTLE CHU.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A man</span> named Li Hua dwelt at Ch‘ang-chou. He
was very well off, and about fifty years of age, but he
had no sons; only one daughter, named Hsiao-hui, a pretty
child on whom her parents doted. When she was fourteen
she had a severe illness and died, leaving their
home desolate and depriving them of their chief pleasure
in life. Mr. Li then bought a concubine, and she by-and-by
bore him a son, who was perfectly idolised, and
called Chu, or the Pearl. This boy grew up to be a
fine manly fellow, though so extremely stupid that when
five or six years old he didn’t know pulse from corn, and
could hardly talk plainly. His father, however, loved
him dearly, and did not observe his faults.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that a one-eyed priest came to collect
alms in the town, and he seemed to know so much about
everybody’s private affairs that the people all looked
upon him as superhuman. He himself declared he had
control over life, death, happiness, and misfortune; and
consequently no one dared refuse him whatever sum he
chose to ask of them. From Li he demanded one hundred
ounces of silver, but was offered only ten, which he
<span class="pagenum" title="i-144"><a id="Page_i-144"></a></span>
refused to receive. This sum was increased to thirty
ounces, whereupon the priest looked sternly at Li and
said, “I must have one hundred; not a fraction less.”
Li now got angry, and went away without giving him
any, the priest, too, rising up in a rage and shouting after
him, “I hope you won’t repent.” Shortly after these
events little Chu fell sick, and crawled about the bed
scratching the mat, his face being of an ashen paleness.
This frightened his father, who hurried off with eighty
ounces of silver, and begged the priest to accept them.
“A large sum like this is no trifling matter to earn,” said
the priest, smiling; “but what can a poor recluse like
myself do for you?” So Li went home, to find that
little Chu was already dead; and this worked him into
such a state that he immediately laid a complaint before
the magistrate. The priest was accordingly summoned
and interrogated; but the magistrate wouldn’t accept his
defence, and ordered him to be bambooed. The blows
sounded as if falling on leather, upon which the magistrate
commanded his lictors to search him; and from
about his person they drew forth two wooden men, a
small coffin, and five small flags. The magistrate here
flew into a passion, and made certain mystic signs with
his fingers, which when the priest saw he was frightened,
and began to excuse himself; but the magistrate would
not listen to him, and had him bambooed to death. Li
thanked him for his kindness, and, taking his leave,
proceeded home. In the evening, after dusk, he was
sitting alone with his wife, when suddenly in popped a
little boy, who said, “Pa! why did you hurry on so fast?
<span class="pagenum" title="i-145"><a id="Page_i-145"></a></span>
I couldn’t catch you up.” Looking at him more closely,
they saw that he was about seven or eight years old, and
Mr. Li, in some alarm, was on the point of questioning
him, when he disappeared, re-appearing again like
smoke, and, curling round and round, got upon the
bed. Li pushed him off, and he fell down without
making any sound, crying out, “Pa! why do you do
this?” and in a moment he was on the bed again.
Li was frightened, and ran away with his wife, the boy
calling after them, “Pa! Ma! boo-oo-oo.” They went
into the next room, bolting the door after them; but
there was the little boy at their heels again. Li asked
him what he wanted, to which he replied, “I belong to
Su-chou; my name is Chan; at six years of age I was
left an orphan; my brother and his wife couldn’t bear
me, so they sent me to live at my maternal grandfather’s.
One day, when playing outside, a wicked priest killed me
by his black art underneath a mulberry-tree, and made
of me an evil spirit, dooming me to everlasting devildom
without hope of transmigration. Happily you exposed him;
and I would now remain with you as your son.” “The
paths of men and devils,” replied Li, “lie in different
directions. How can we remain together?” “Give me
only a tiny room,” cried the boy, “a bed, a mattress, and
a cup of cold gruel every day. I ask for nothing more.”
So Li agreed, to the great delight of the boy, who slept
by himself in another part of the house, coming in the
morning and walking in and out like any ordinary
person. Hearing Li’s concubine crying bitterly, he
asked how long little Chu had been dead, and she
<span class="pagenum" title="i-146"><a id="Page_i-146"></a></span>
told him seven days. “It’s cold weather now,” said
he, “and the body can’t have decomposed. Have the
grave opened, and let me see it; if not too far gone, I
can bring him to life again.” Li was only too pleased,
and went off with the boy; and when they opened the
grave they found the body in perfect preservation; but
while Li was controlling his emotions, lo! the boy had
vanished from his sight. Wondering very much at this,
he took little Chu’s body home, and had hardly laid it
on the bed when he noticed the eyes move. Little Chu
then called for some broth, which put him into a perspiration,
and then he got up. They were all overjoyed to
see him come to life again; and, what is more, he was
much brighter and cleverer than before. At night, however,
he lay perfectly stiff and rigid, without shewing any
signs of life; and, as he didn’t move when they turned
him over and over, they were much frightened, and
thought he had died again. But towards daybreak he
awaked as if from a dream, and in reply to their questions
said that when he was with the wicked priest there
was another boy named Ko-tzŭ;<a id="Anchor-130" title="Go to Footnote 130" href="#Footnote-130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and that the day
before, when he had been unable to catch up his father,
it was because he had stayed behind to bid adieu to
Ko-tzŭ; that Ko-tzŭ was now the son of an official in
Purgatory named Chiang, and very comfortably settled;
and that he had invited him (Chan) to go and play with
<span class="pagenum" title="i-147"><a id="Page_i-147"></a></span>
him that evening, and had sent him back on a white-nosed
horse. His mother then asked him if he had
seen little Chu in Purgatory; to which he replied,
“Little Chu has already been born again. He and our
father here had not really the destiny of father and son.
Little Chu was merely a man named Yen Tzŭ-fang, from
Chin-ling, who had come to reclaim an old debt.”<a id="Anchor-131" title="Go to Footnote 131" href="#Footnote-131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Now
Mr. Li had formerly traded to Chin-ling, and actually
owed money for goods to a Mr. Yen; but he had died,
and no one else knew anything about it, so that he was
now greatly alarmed when he heard this story. His
mother next asked (the quasi) little Chu if he had seen
his sister, Hsiao-hui; and he said he had not, promising
to go again and inquire about her. A few days afterwards
he told his mother that Hsiao-hui was very happy
in Purgatory, being married to a son of one of the
Judges; and that she had any quantity of jewels,<a id="Anchor-132" title="Go to Footnote 132" href="#Footnote-132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and
crowds of attendants when she went abroad. “Why
doesn’t she come home to see her parents?” asked his
mother. “Well,” replied the boy, “dead people, you
know, haven’t got any flesh or bones; however, if you
can only remind them of something that happened in
their past lives, their feelings are at once touched. So
yesterday I managed, through Mr. Chiang, to get an
interview with Hsiao-hui; and we sat together on a coral
<span class="pagenum" title="i-148"><a id="Page_i-148"></a></span>
couch, and I spoke to her of her father and mother at
home, all of which she listened to as if she was asleep.
I then remarked, ‘Sister, when you were alive you were
very fond of embroidering double-stemmed flowers; and
once you cut your finger with the scissors, and the blood
ran over the silk, but you brought it into the picture as
a crimson cloud. Your mother has that picture still,
hanging at the head of her bed, a perpetual souvenir of
you. Sister, have you forgotten this?’ Then she burst
into tears, and promised to ask her husband to let her
come and visit you.” His mother asked when she
would arrive; but he said he could not tell. However,
one day he ran in and cried out, “Mother, Hsiao-hui
has come, with a splendid equipage and a train of
servants; we had better get plenty of wine ready.” In
a few moments he came in again, saying, “Here is my
sister,” at the same time asking her to take a seat and
rest. He then wept; but none of those present saw
anything at all. By-and-by he went out and burnt a
quantity of paper money<a id="Anchor-133" title="Go to Footnote 133" href="#Footnote-133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and made offerings of wine
outside the door, returning shortly and saying he had
sent away her attendants for a while. Hsiao-hui then
<span class="pagenum" title="i-149"><a id="Page_i-149"></a></span>
asked if the green coverlet, a small portion of which had
been burnt by a candle, was still in existence. “It is,”
replied her mother, and, going to a box, she at once
produced the coverlet. “Hsiao-hui would like a bed
made up for her in her old room,” said her (quasi)
brother; “she wants to rest awhile, and will talk with
you again in the morning.”</p>

<p>Now their next-door neighbour, named Chao, had a
daughter who was formerly a great friend of Hsiao-hui’s,
and that night she dreamt that Hsiao-hui appeared with
a turban on her head and a red mantle over her shoulders,
and that they talked and laughed together precisely
as in days gone by. “I am now a spirit,” said
Hsiao-hui, “and my father and mother can no more see
me than if I was far separated from them. Dear sister,
I would borrow your body, from which to speak to them.
You need fear nothing.” On the morrow when Miss
Chao met her mother, she fell on the ground before her
and remained some time in a state of unconsciousness,
at length saying, “Madam, it is many years since we
met; your hair has become very white.” “The girl’s
mad,” said her mother, in alarm; and, thinking something
had gone wrong, proceeded to follow her out of
the door. Miss Chao went straight to Li’s house, and
there with tears embraced Mrs. Li, who did not know
what to make of it all. “Yesterday,” said Miss Chao,
“when I came back, I was unhappily unable to speak
with you. Unfilial wretch that I was, to die before you,
and leave you to mourn my loss. How can I redeem
such behaviour?” Her mother thereupon began to
<span class="pagenum" title="i-150"><a id="Page_i-150"></a></span>
understand the scene, and, weeping, said to her, “I have
heard that you hold an honourable position, and this is a
great comfort to me; but, living as you do in the palace
of a Judge, how is it you are able to get away?” “My
husband,” replied she, “is very kind; and his parents
treat me with all possible consideration. I experience
no harsh treatment at their hands.” Here Miss Chao
rested her cheek upon her hand, exactly as Hsiao-hui
had been wont to do when she was alive; and at that
moment in came her brother to say that her attendants
were ready to return. “I must go,” said she, rising up
and weeping bitterly all the time; after which she fell
down, and remained some time unconscious as before.</p>

<p>Shortly after these events Mr. Li became dangerously
ill, and no medicines were of any avail, so that his son
feared they would not be able to save his life. Two
devils sat at the head of his bed, one holding an iron
staff, the other a nettle-hemp rope four or five feet in
length. Day and night his son implored them to go,
but they would not move; and Mrs. Li in sorrow began
to prepare the funeral clothes.<a id="Anchor-134" title="Go to Footnote 134" href="#Footnote-134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Towards evening her
son entered and cried out, “Strangers and women, leave
the room! My sister’s husband is coming to see his
father-in-law.” He then clapped his hands, and burst
out laughing. “What is the matter?” asked his mother.
<span class="pagenum" title="i-151"><a id="Page_i-151"></a></span>
“I am laughing,” answered he, “because when the two
devils heard my sister’s husband was coming, they both
ran under the bed, like terrapins, drawing in their
heads.” By-and-by, looking at nothing, he began to talk
about the weather, and ask his sister’s husband how he
did, and then he clapped his hands, and said, “I begged
the two devils to go, but they would not; it’s all right
now.” After this he went out to the door and returned,
saying, “My sister’s husband has gone. He took away
the two devils tied to his horse. My father ought to get
better now. Besides, Hsiao-hui’s husband said he would
speak to the Judge, and obtain a hundred years’ lease of
life both for you and my father.” The whole family
rejoiced exceedingly at this, and, when night came, Mr.
Li was better, and in a few days quite well again. A
tutor was engaged for (the quasi) little Chu, who shewed
himself an apt pupil, and at eighteen years of age took
his bachelor’s degree. He could also see things of the
other world; and when anyone in the village was ill, he
pointed out where the devils were, and burnt them out
with fire, so that everybody got well. However, before
long he himself became very ill, and his flesh turned
green and purple; whereupon he said, “The devils
afflict me thus because I let out their secrets. Henceforth
I shall never divulge them again.”</p>

<br/>
MISS QUARTA HU.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Shang</span> was a native of T‘ai-shan, and lived
quietly with his books alone. One autumn night
when the Silver River<a id="Anchor-135" title="Go to Footnote 135" href="#Footnote-135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> was unusually distinct and the
moon shining brightly in the sky, he was walking up
and down under the shade, with his thoughts wandering
somewhat at random, when lo! a young girl leaped
over the wall, and, smiling, asked him, “What are you
thinking about, Sir, all so deeply?” Shang looked at
her, and seeing that she had a pretty face, asked her to
walk in. She then told him her name was Hu,<a id="Anchor-136" title="Go to Footnote 136" href="#Footnote-136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and
that she was called Tertia; but when he wanted to
know where she lived, she laughed and would not say.
So he did not inquire any further; and by degrees
they struck up a friendship, and Miss Tertia used to
come and chat with him every evening. He was so
smitten that he could hardly take his eyes off her,
and at last she said to him, “What <em>are</em> you looking
<span class="pagenum" title="i-153"><a id="Page_i-153"></a></span>
at?” “At you,” cried he, “my lovely rose, my beautiful
peach. I could gaze at you all night long.” “If
you think so much of poor me,” answered she, “I
don’t know where your wits would be if you saw my
sister Quarta.” Mr. Shang said he was sorry he didn’t
know her, and begged that he might be introduced;
so next night Miss Tertia brought her sister, who turned
out to be a young damsel of about fifteen, with a face
delicately powdered and resembling the lily, or like an
apricot-flower seen through mist; and altogether as
pretty a girl as he had ever seen. Mr. Shang was
charmed with her, and inviting them in, began to laugh
and talk with the elder, while Miss Quarta sat playing
with her girdle, and keeping her eyes on the ground.
By-and-by Miss Tertia got up and said she was going,
whereupon her sister rose to take leave also; but Mr.
Shang asked her not to be in a hurry, and requested the
elder to assist in persuading her. “You needn’t hurry,”
said she to Miss Quarta; and accordingly the latter
remained chatting with Mr. Shang without reserve, and
finally told him she was a fox. However, Mr. Shang
was so occupied with her beauty, that he didn’t pay
any heed to that; but she added, “And my sister is very
dangerous; she has already killed three people. Any
one bewitched by her has no chance of escape. Happily,
you have bestowed your affections on me, and I
shall not allow you to be destroyed. You must break
off your acquaintance with her at once.” Mr. Shang
was very frightened, and implored her to help him; to
which she replied, “Although a fox, I am skilled in the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-154"><a id="Page_i-154"></a></span>
arts of the Immortals;<a id="Anchor-137" title="Go to Footnote 137" href="#Footnote-137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> I will write out a charm for
you which you must paste on the door, and thus you
will keep her away.” So she wrote down the charm,
and in the morning when her sister came and saw it,
she fell back, crying out, “Ungrateful minx! you’ve
thrown me up for him, have you? You two being
destined for each other, what have I done that you
should treat me thus?” She then went away; and a
few days afterwards Miss Quarta said she too would
have to be absent for a day, so Shang went out for a
walk by himself, and suddenly beheld a very nice-looking
young lady emerge from the shade of an old
oak that was growing on the hill-side. “Why so dreadfully
pensive?” said she to him; “those Hu girls can
never bring you a single cent.” She then presented
Shang with some money, and bade him go on ahead
and buy some good wine, adding, “I’ll bring something
to eat with me, and we’ll have a jolly time of it.”
Shang took the money and went home, doing as the
young lady had told him; and by-and-by in she herself
came, and threw on the table a roast chicken and a
shoulder of salt pork, which she at once proceeded to
cut up. They now set to work to enjoy themselves, and
had hardly finished when they heard some one coming
in, and the next minute in walked Miss Tertia and her
sister. The strange young lady didn’t know where to
hide, and managed to lose her shoes; but the other two
<span class="pagenum" title="i-155"><a id="Page_i-155"></a></span>
began to revile her, saying, “Out upon you, base fox;
what are you doing here?” They then chased her
away after some trouble, and Shang began to excuse
himself to them, until at last they all became friends
again as before.</p>

<p>One day, however, a Shensi man arrived, riding on a
donkey, and coming to the door said, “I have long
been in search of these evil spirits: now I have got
them.” Shang’s father thought the man’s remark rather
strange, and asked him whence he had come. “Across
much land and sea,” replied he; “for eight or nine
months out of every year I am absent from my native
place. These devils killed my brother with their poison,
alas! alas! and I have sworn to exterminate them; but
I have travelled many miles without being able to find
them. They are now in your house, and if you do not
cut them off, you will die even as my brother.” Now
Shang and the young ladies had kept their acquaintanceship
very dark; but his father and mother had guessed
that something was up, and, much alarmed, bade the
Shensi man walk in and perform his exorcisms. The
latter then produced two bottles which he placed upon
the ground, and proceeded to mutter a number of
charms and cabalistic formulæ; whereupon four wreaths
of smoke passed two by two into each bottle. “I have
the whole family,” cried he, in an ecstasy of delight;
as he proceeded to tie down the mouths of the bottles
with pig’s bladder, sealing them with the utmost care.
Shang’s father was likewise very pleased, and kept his
guest to dinner; but the young man himself was sadly
<span class="pagenum" title="i-156"><a id="Page_i-156"></a></span>
dejected, and approaching the bottles unperceived,
bent his ear to listen. “Ungrateful man,” said Miss
Quarta from within, “to sit there and make no effort
to save me.” This was more than Shang could stand,
and he immediately broke the seal, but found that he
couldn’t untie the knot. “Not so,” cried Miss Quarta;
“merely lay down the flag that now stands on the
altar, and with a pin prick the bladder, and I can
get out.” Shang did as she bade him, and in a
moment a thin streak of white smoke issued forth
from the hole and disappeared in the clouds. When
the Shensi man came out, and saw the flag lying on
the ground, he started violently, and cried out, “Escaped!
This must be your doing, young Sir.” He
then shook the bottle and listened, finally exclaiming,
“Luckily only one has got away. She was fated not
to die, and may therefore be pardoned.”<a id="Anchor-138" title="Go to Footnote 138" href="#Footnote-138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Thereupon
he took the bottles and went his way.</p>

<p>Some years afterwards Shang was one day superintending
his reapers cutting the corn, when he descried
Miss Quarta at a distance, sitting under a tree. He
approached, and she took his hand, saying, “Ten
years have rolled away since last we met. Since then

I have gained the prize of immortality;<a id="Anchor-139" title="Go to Footnote 139" href="#Footnote-139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> but I thought
that perhaps you had not quite forgotten me, and so I
came to see you once more.” Shang wished her to
return home with him; to which she replied, “I am
no longer what I was that I should mingle in the
affairs of mortals. We shall meet again.” And as she
said this, she disappeared; but twenty years later, when
Shang was one day alone, Miss Quarta walked in.
Shang was overjoyed, and began to address her; but
she answered him, saying, “My name is already enrolled
in the Register of the Immortals, and I have no
right to return to earth. However, out of gratitude to
you I determined to announce to you the date of your
dissolution that you might put your affairs in order.
Fear nothing; I will see you safely through to the happy
land.” She then departed, and on the day named Shang
actually died. A relative of a friend of mine, Mr.
Li Wên-yü, frequently met the above-mentioned Mr.
Shang.<a id="Anchor-140" title="Go to Footnote 140" href="#Footnote-140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

MR. CHU, THE CONSIDERATE
HUSBAND.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> the village of Chu in Chi-yang, there was a man
named Chu, who died at the age of fifty and odd
years. His family at once proceeded to put on their
mourning robes, when suddenly they heard the dead
man cry out. Rushing up to the coffin, they found that
he had come to life again; and began, full of joy, to
ask him all about it. But the old gentleman replied
only to his wife, saying, “When I died I did not expect
to come back. However, by the time I had got a few
miles on my way, I thought of the poor old body I was
leaving behind me, dependent for everything on others,
and with no more enjoyment of life. So I made up
my mind to return, and take you away with me.” The
bystanders thought this was only the disconnected talk
of a man who had just regained consciousness, and
attached no importance to it; but the old man repeated
it, and then his wife said, “It’s all very well,
but you have only just come to life; how can you go
and die again directly?” “It is extremely simple,”
replied her husband; “you go and pack up everything
ready.” The old lady laughed and did nothing; upon
<span class="pagenum" title="i-159"><a id="Page_i-159"></a></span>
which Mr. Chu urged her again to prepare, and then
left the house. In a short time he returned, and his
wife pretended that she had done what he wanted.
“Then you had better dress,” said he; but Mrs. Chu
did not move until he pressed her again and again,
after which she did not like to cross him, and by-and-by
came out all fully equipped. The other ladies of the
family were laughing on the sly, when Mr. Chu laid
his head upon the pillow, and told his wife to do
likewise. “It’s too ridiculous,” she was beginning to
say, when Mr. Chu banged the bed with his hand, and
cried out, “What is there to laugh at in dying?” upon
which the various members of the family, seeing the
old gentleman was in a rage, begged her to gratify
his whim. Mrs. Chu then lay down alongside of her
husband, to the infinite amusement of the spectators;
but it was soon noticed that the old lady had ceased
to smile, and by-and-by her two eyes closed. For a
long time not a sound was heard, as if she was fast
asleep; and when some of those present approached to
touch her, they found she was as cold as ice, and
no longer breathing; then, turning to her husband,
they perceived that he also had passed away.</p>

<p>This story was fully related by a younger sister-in-law
of Mr. Chu’s, who, in the twenty-first year of the
reign K‘ang Hsi,<a id="Anchor-141" title="Go to Footnote 141" href="#Footnote-141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> was employed in the house of a high
official named Pi.</p>

<br/>
THE MAGNANIMOUS GIRL.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Chin-ling there lived a young man named Ku,
who had considerable ability but was very poor; and
having an old mother, he was very loth to leave home.
So he employed himself in writing or painting<a id="Anchor-142" title="Go to Footnote 142" href="#Footnote-142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> for
people, and gave his mother the proceeds, going on
thus till he was twenty-five years of age without taking
a wife. Opposite to their house was another building,
which had long been untenanted; and one day an old
woman and a young girl came to occupy it, but there
being no gentleman with them young Ku did not
make any inquiries as to who they were or whence
they hailed. Shortly afterwards it chanced that just
as Ku was entering the house he observed a young
lady come out of his mother’s door. She was about
<span class="pagenum" title="i-161"><a id="Page_i-161"></a></span>
eighteen or nineteen, very clever and refined looking, and
altogether such a girl as one rarely sets eyes on; and when
she noticed Mr. Ku, she did not run away, but seemed
quite self-possessed. “It was the young lady over the
way; she came to borrow my scissors and measure,” said
his mother, “and she told me that there was only her
mother and herself. They don’t seem to belong to the
lower classes. I asked her why she didn’t get married,
to which she replied that her mother was old. I must
go and call on her to-morrow, and find out how the
land lies. If she doesn’t expect too much, you could
take care of her mother for her.” So next day Ku’s
mother went, and found that the girl’s mother was
deaf, and that they were evidently poor, apparently not
having a day’s food in the house. Ku’s mother asked
what their employment was, and the old lady said they
trusted for food to her daughter’s ten fingers. She
then threw out some hints about uniting the two
families, to which the old lady seemed to agree; but,
on consultation with her daughter, the latter would not
consent. Mrs. Ku returned home and told her son,
saying, “Perhaps she thinks we are too poor. She
doesn’t speak or laugh, is very nice-looking, and as
pure as snow; truly no ordinary girl.” There ended
that; until one day, as Ku was sitting in his study,
up came a very agreeable young fellow, who said he
was from a neighbouring village, and engaged Ku to
draw a picture for him. The two youths soon struck
up a firm friendship and met constantly, when it happened
that the stranger chanced to see the young
<span class="pagenum" title="i-162"><a id="Page_i-162"></a></span>
lady of over the way. “Who is that?” said he, following
her with his eyes. Ku told him, and then he
said, “She is certainly pretty, but rather stern in her
appearance.” By-and-by Ku went in, and his mother
told him the girl had come to beg a little rice, as they had
had nothing to eat all day. “She’s a good daughter,”
said his mother, “and I’m very sorry for her. We
must try and help them a little.” Ku thereupon
shouldered a peck of rice, and, knocking at their door,
presented it with his mother’s compliments. The young
lady received the rice but said nothing; and then she
got into the habit of coming over and helping Ku’s
mother with her work and household affairs, almost as
if she had been her daughter-in-law, for which Ku was
very grateful to her, and whenever he had anything nice
he always sent some of it in to her mother, though the
young lady herself never once took the trouble to thank
him. So things went on until Ku’s mother got an
abscess on her leg, and lay writhing in agony day and
night. Then the young lady devoted herself to the
invalid, waiting on her and giving her medicine with
such care and attention that at last the sick woman
cried out, “Oh, that I could secure such a daughter-in-law
as you, to see this old body into its grave!” The
young lady soothed her, and replied, “Your son is a
hundred times more filial than I, a poor widow’s only
daughter.” “But even a filial son makes a bad nurse,”
answered the patient; “besides, I am now drawing
towards the evening of my life, when my body will be
exposed to the mists and the dews, and I am vexed in
<span class="pagenum" title="i-163"><a id="Page_i-163"></a></span>
spirit about our ancestral worship and the continuance
of our line.” As she was speaking Ku walked in; and
his mother, weeping, said, “I am deeply indebted to
this young lady; do not forget to repay her goodness.”
Ku made a low bow, but the young lady said, “Sir,
when you were kind to my mother, I did not thank
you; why, then, thank me?” Ku thereupon became
more than ever attached to her; but could never get
her to depart in the slightest degree from her cold
demeanour towards himself. One day, however, he
managed to squeeze her hand, upon which she told
him never to do so again; and then for some time he
neither saw nor heard anything of her. She had conceived
a violent dislike to the young stranger above-mentioned;
and one evening when he was sitting
talking with Ku, the young lady reappeared. After a
while she got angry at something he said, and drew from
her robe a glittering knife about a foot long. The
young man, seeing her do this, ran out in a fright and
she after him, only to find that he had vanished. She
then threw her dagger up into the air, and whish! a
streak of light like a rainbow, and something came
tumbling down with a flop. Ku got a light, and ran to
see what it was; and lo! there lay a white fox, head
in one place and body in another. “There is your
<em>friend</em>,” cried the girl; “I knew he would cause me to
destroy him sooner or later.” Ku dragged it into the
house, and said, “Let us wait till to-morrow to talk it
over; we shall then be more calm.” Next day the
young lady arrived, and Ku inquired about her knowledge
<span class="pagenum" title="i-164"><a id="Page_i-164"></a></span>
of the black art; but she told Ku not to trouble
himself about such affairs, and to keep it secret or it
might be prejudicial to his happiness. Ku then entreated
her to consent to their union, to which she
replied that she had already been as it were a daughter-in-law
to his mother, and there was no need to push
the thing further. “Is it because I am poor?” asked
Ku. “Well, I am not rich,” answered she, “but the
fact is I had rather not.” She then took her leave, and
the next evening when Ku went across to their house to
try once more to persuade her, the young lady had disappeared,
and was never seen again.</p>

<br/>
THE BOON-COMPANION.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Once</span> upon a time there was a young man named
Ch‘ê, who was not particularly well off, but at the same
time very fond of his wine; so much so, that without
his three stoups of liquor every night, he was quite
unable to sleep, and bottles were seldom absent from
the head of his bed. One night he had waked up
and was turning over and over, when he fancied some
one was in the bed with him; but then, thinking it
was only the clothes which had slipped off, he put
out his hand to feel, and, lo! he touched something
silky like a cat, only larger. Striking a light, he found
it was a fox, lying in a drunken sleep like a dog; and
then looking at his wine bottle he saw that it had
been emptied. “A boon-companion,” said he, laughing,
as he avoided startling the animal, and covering it
up, lay down to sleep with his arm across it, and the
candle alight so as to see what transformation it might
undergo. About midnight, the fox stretched itself,
and Ch‘ê cried, “Well, to be sure, you’ve had a nice
sleep!” He then drew off the clothes, and beheld an
elegant young man in a scholar’s dress; but the young
<span class="pagenum" title="i-166"><a id="Page_i-166"></a></span>
man jumped up, and making a low obeisance, returned
his host many thanks for not cutting off his head.
“Oh,” replied Ch‘ê, “I am not averse to liquor myself;
in fact they say I’m too much given to it. You
shall play Pythias to my Damon;<a id="Anchor-143" title="Go to Footnote 143" href="#Footnote-143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and if you have
no objection, we’ll be a pair of bottle-and-glass chums.”
So they lay down and went to sleep again, Ch‘ê urging
the young man to visit him often, and saying that they
must have faith in each other. The fox agreed to
this, but when Ch‘ê awoke in the morning his bedfellow
had already disappeared. So he prepared a goblet
of first-rate wine in expectation of his friend’s arrival,
and at nightfall sure enough he came. They then sat
together drinking, and the fox cracked so many jokes
that Ch‘ê said he regretted he had not known him
before. “And truly I don’t know how to repay your
kindness,” replied the former, “in preparing all this
nice wine for me.” “Oh,” said Ch‘ê, “what’s a pint
or so of wine?&mdash;nothing worth speaking of.” “Well,”
rejoined the fox, “you are only a poor scholar, and
money isn’t so easily to be got. I must try if I can’t secure
a little wine capital for you.” Next evening when
he arrived, he said to Ch‘ê, “Two miles down towards
the south-east you will find some silver lying by the
wayside. Go early in the morning and get it.” So on
the morrow Ch‘ê set off and actually obtained two lumps
<span class="pagenum" title="i-167"><a id="Page_i-167"></a></span>
of silver with which he bought some choice morsels
to help them out with their wine that evening. The
fox now told him that there was a vault in his back-yard
which he ought to open; and when he did so,
he found therein more than a hundred strings of cash.<a id="Anchor-144" title="Go to Footnote 144" href="#Footnote-144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
“Now then,” cried Ch‘ê, delighted, “I shall have no
more anxiety about funds for buying wine with all this
in my purse.” “Ah,” replied the fox, “the water in
a puddle is not inexhaustible. I must do something
further for you.” Some days afterwards the fox said
to Ch‘ê, “Buckwheat is very cheap in the market just
now. Something is to be done in this line.” Accordingly,
Ch‘ê bought over forty tons, and thereby incurred
general ridicule; but by-and-by there was a bad drought
and all kinds of grain and beans were spoilt. Only
buckwheat would grow, and Ch‘ê sold off his stock
at a profit of one thousand per cent. His wealth thus
began to increase; he bought two hundred acres of rich
land, and always planted his crops, corn, millet, or what
not, upon the advice of the fox secretly given him
beforehand. The fox looked on Ch‘ê’s wife as a
sister, and on Ch‘ê’s children as his own; but when,
subsequently, Ch‘ê died, it never came to the house
again.</p>

<br/>
MISS LIEN-HSIANG.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">There</span> was a young man named Sang Tzŭ-ming, a
native of I-chou, who had been left an orphan when
quite young. He lived near the Saffron market, and
kept himself very much to himself, only going out twice
a day for his meals to a neighbour’s close by, and sitting
quietly at home all the rest of his time. One day
the said neighbour called, and asked him in joke if
he wasn’t afraid of devil-foxes, so much alone as he
was. “Oh,” replied Sang, laughing, “what has the
superior man<a id="Anchor-145" title="Go to Footnote 145" href="#Footnote-145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> to fear from devil-foxes. If they come
as men, I have here a sharp sword for them; and if
as women, why, I shall open the door and ask them
to walk in.” The neighbour went away, and having
arranged with a friend of his, they got a young lady
of their acquaintance to climb over Sang’s wall with
the help of a ladder, and knock at the door. Sang
peeped through, and called out, “Who’s there?” to which
<span class="pagenum" title="i-169"><a id="Page_i-169"></a></span>
the girl answered, “A devil!” and frightened Sang so
dreadfully that his teeth chattered in his head. The
girl then ran away, and next morning when his neighbour
came to see him, Sang told him what had happened,
and said he meant to go back to his native place. The
neighbour then clapped his hands, and said to Sang,
“Why didn’t you ask her in?” Whereupon Sang perceived
that he had been tricked, and went on quietly
again as before.</p>

<p>Some six months afterwards, a young lady knocked at
his door; and Sang, thinking his friends were at their old
tricks, opened it at once, and asked her to walk in. She
did so; and he beheld to his astonishment a perfect
Helen for beauty.<a id="Anchor-146" title="Go to Footnote 146" href="#Footnote-146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Asking her whence she came, she
replied that her name was Lien-hsiang, and that she
lived not very far off, adding that she had long been
anxious to make his acquaintance. After that she
used to drop in every now and again for a chat; but
one evening when Sang was sitting alone expecting her,
another young lady suddenly walked in. Thinking it
was Lien-hsiang, Sang got up to meet her, but found
that the new-comer was somebody else. She was about
fifteen or sixteen years of age, wore very full sleeves, and
dressed her hair after the fashion of unmarried girls,
being otherwise very stylish-looking and refined, and
apparently hesitating whether to go on or go back.
<span class="pagenum" title="i-170"><a id="Page_i-170"></a></span>
Sang, in a great state of alarm, took her for a fox;
but the young lady said, “My name is Li, and I am
of a respectable family. Hearing of your virtue and
talent, I hope to be accorded the honour of your
acquaintance.” Sang laughed, and took her by the
hand, which he found was as cold as ice; and when
he asked the reason, she told him that she had always
been delicate, and that it was very chilly outside. She
then remarked that she intended to visit him pretty
frequently, and hoped it would not inconvenience him;
so he explained that no one came to see him except
another young lady, and that not very often. “When
she comes, I’ll go,” replied the young lady, “and only
drop in when she’s not here.” She then gave him an
embroidered slipper, saying that she had worn it, and
that whenever he shook it she would know that he
wanted to see her, cautioning him at the same time
never to shake it before strangers. Taking it in his
hand he beheld a very tiny little shoe almost as fine
pointed as an awl, with which he was much pleased; and
next evening, when nobody was present, he produced the
shoe and shook it, whereupon the young lady immediately
walked in. Henceforth, whenever he brought
it out, the young lady responded to his wishes and
appeared before him. This seemed so strange that at
last he asked her to give him some explanation; but she
only laughed, and said it was mere coincidence. One
evening after this Lien-hsiang came, and said in alarm
to Sang, “Whatever has made you look so melancholy?”
Sang replied that he did not know, and by-and-by she
<span class="pagenum" title="i-171"><a id="Page_i-171"></a></span>
took her leave, saying, they would not meet again for
some ten days. During this period Miss Li visited
Sang every day, and on one occasion asked him where
his other friend was. Sang told her; and then she
laughed and said, “What is your opinion of me as
compared with Lien-hsiang?” “You are both of you
perfection,” replied he, “but you are a little <em>colder</em> of
the two.” Miss Li didn’t much like this, and cried
out, “<i>Both of us perfection</i> is what you say to <em>me</em>. Then
she must be a downright Cynthia,<a id="Anchor-147" title="Go to Footnote 147" href="#Footnote-147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> and I am no match
for her.” Somewhat out of temper, she reckoned that
Lien-hsiang’s ten days had expired, and said she would
have a peep at her, making Sang promise to keep it
all secret. The next evening Lien-hsiang came, and
while they were talking she suddenly exclaimed, “Oh,
dear! how much worse you seem to have become in
the last ten days. You must have encountered something
bad.” Sang asked her why so; to which she
answered, “First of all your appearance; and then
your pulse is very thready.<a id="Anchor-148" title="Go to Footnote 148" href="#Footnote-148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> You’ve got the devil-disease.”</p>

<p>The following evening when Miss Li came, Sang
asked her what she thought of Lien-hsiang. “Oh,”
said she, “there’s no question about her beauty; but
she’s a fox. When she went away I followed her to
her hole on the hill side.” Sang, however, attributed this
<span class="pagenum" title="i-172"><a id="Page_i-172"></a></span>
remark to jealousy, and took no notice of it; but the
next evening when Lien-hsiang came, he observed, “I
don’t believe it myself, but some one has told me you
are a fox.” Lien-hsiang asked who had said so, to which
Sang replied that he was only joking; and then she
begged him to explain what difference there was between
a fox and an ordinary person. “Well,” answered Sang,
“foxes frighten people to death, and, therefore, they are
very much dreaded.” “Don’t you believe that!” cried
Lien-hsiang; “and now tell me who has been saying
this of me.” Sang declared at first that it was only
a joke of his, but by-and-by yielded to her instances,
and let out the whole story. “Of course I saw how
changed you were,” said Lien-hsiang; “she is surely not
a human being to be able to cause such a rapid alteration
in you. Say nothing, to-morrow I’ll watch her as she
watched me.” The following evening Miss Li came
in; and they had hardly interchanged half-a-dozen
sentences when a cough was heard outside the window,
and Miss Li ran away. Lien-hsiang then entered and
said to Sang, “You are lost! She is a devil, and if you
do not at once forbid her coming here, you will soon
be on the road to the other world.” “All jealousy,”
thought Sang, saying nothing, as Lien-hsiang continued,
“I know that you don’t like to be rude to her; but I,
for my part, cannot see you sacrificed, and to-morrow
I will bring you some medicine to expel the poison from
your system. Happily, the disease has not yet taken
firm hold of you, and in ten days you will be well again.”
The next evening she produced a knife and chopped
<span class="pagenum" title="i-173"><a id="Page_i-173"></a></span>
up some medicine for Sang, which made him feel much
better; but, although he was very grateful to her, he still
persisted in disbelieving that he had the devil-disease.
After some days he recovered and Lien-hsiang left him,
warning him to have no more to do with Miss Li. Sang
pretended that he would follow her advice, and closed the
door and trimmed his lamp. He then took out the slipper,
and on shaking it Miss Li appeared, somewhat cross
at having been kept away for several days. “She merely
attended on me these few nights while I was ill,” said
Sang; “don’t be angry.” At this Miss Li brightened
up a little; but by-and-by Sang told her that people
said she was a devil. “It’s that nasty fox,” cried Miss
Li, after a pause, “putting these things into your head.
If you don’t break with her, I won’t come here again.”
She then began to sob and cry, and Sang had some
trouble in pacifying her. Next evening Lien-hsiang
came and found out that Miss Li had been there again;
whereupon she was very angry with Sang, and told him
he would certainly die. “Why need you be so jealous?”
said Sang, laughing; at which she only got more enraged,
and replied, “When you were nearly dying the other day
and I saved you, if I had not been jealous, where would
you have been now?” Sang pretended he was only
joking, and said that Miss Li had told him his recent
illness was entirely owing to the machinations of a fox;
to which she replied, “It’s true enough what you say,
only you don’t see <em>whose</em> machinations. However, if
any thing happens to you, I should never clear myself
even had I a hundred mouths; we will, therefore, part.
<span class="pagenum" title="i-174"><a id="Page_i-174"></a></span>
A hundred days hence I shall see you on your bed.”
Sang could not persuade her to stay, and away she
went; and from that time Miss Li became a regular
visitor.</p>

<p>Two months passed away, and Sang began to experience
a feeling of great lassitude, which he tried at first
to shake off, but by-and-by he became very thin, and could
only take thick gruel. He then thought about going back
to his native place; however, he could not bear to leave
Miss Li, and in a few more days he was so weak that he
was unable to get up. His friend next door, seeing how
ill he was, daily sent in his boy with food and drink; and
now Sang began for the first time to suspect Miss Li.
So he said to her, “I am sorry I didn’t listen to Lien-hsiang
before I got as bad as this.” He then closed
his eyes and kept them shut for some time; and when
he opened them again Miss Li had disappeared. Their
acquaintanceship was thus at an end, and Sang lay all
emaciated as he was upon his bed in his solitary room
longing for the return of Lien-hsiang. One day, while
he was still thinking about her, some one drew aside the
screen and walked in. It was Lien-hsiang; and approaching
the bed she said with a smile, “Was I then
talking such nonsense?” Sang struggled a long time
to speak; and, at length, confessing he had been wrong,
implored her to save him. “When the disease has
reached such a pitch as this,” replied Lien-hsiang, “there
is very little to be done. I merely came to bid you farewell,
and to clear up your doubts about my jealousy.” In
great tribulation, Sang asked her to take something she
<span class="pagenum" title="i-175"><a id="Page_i-175"></a></span>
would find under his pillow and destroy it; and she
accordingly drew forth the slipper, which she proceeded
to examine by the light of the lamp, turning it over and
over. All at once Miss Li walked in, but when she
saw Lien-hsiang she turned back as though she would
run away, which Lien-hsiang instantly prevented by
placing herself in the doorway. Sang then began to
reproach her, and Miss Li could make no reply; whereupon
Lien-hsiang said, “At last we meet. Formerly you
attributed this gentleman’s illness to me; what have you
to say now?” Miss Li bent her head in acknowledgment
of her guilt, and Lien-hsiang continued, “How
is it that a nice girl like you can thus turn love into
hate?” Here Miss Li threw herself on the ground
in a flood of tears and begged for mercy; and Lien-hsiang,
raising her up, inquired of her as to her past
life. “I am a daughter of a petty official named
Li, and I died young, leaving the web of my destiny
incomplete, like the silkworm that perishes in
the spring. To be the partner of this gentleman
was my ardent wish; but I had never any intention of
causing his death.” “I have heard,” remarked Lien-hsiang,
“that the advantage devils obtain by killing
people is that their victims are ever with them after
death. Is this so?” “It is not,” replied Miss Li; “the
companionship of two devils gives no pleasure to either.
Were it otherwise, I should not have wanted for friends
in the realms below. But tell me, how do foxes manage
not to kill people?” “You allude to such foxes as suck
the breath out of people?” replied Lien-hsiang; “I am
<span class="pagenum" title="i-176"><a id="Page_i-176"></a></span>
not of that class. Some foxes are harmless; no devils
are,<a id="Anchor-149" title="Go to Footnote 149" href="#Footnote-149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> because of the dominance of the <i>yin</i><a id="Anchor-150" title="Go to Footnote 150" href="#Footnote-150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> in their compositions.”
Sang now knew that these two girls were
really a fox and a devil; however, from being long
accustomed to their society, he was not in the least
alarmed. His breathing had dwindled to a mere thread,
and at length he uttered a cry of pain. Lien-hsiang
looked round and said, “How shall we cure him?”
upon which Miss Li blushed deeply and drew back; and
then Lien-hsiang added, “If he does get well, I’m afraid
you will be dreadfully jealous.” Miss Li drew herself
up, and replied, “Could a physician be found to wipe
away the wrong I have done to this gentleman, I would
bury my head in the ground. How should I look the
world in the face?” Lien-hsiang here opened a bag and
drew forth some drugs, saying, “I have been looking
forward to this day. When I left this gentleman I
proceeded to gather my simples, as it would take three
months for the medicine to be got ready; but then,
should the poison have brought anyone even to death’s
door, this medicine is able to call him back. The only
condition is that it be administered by the very hand
<span class="pagenum" title="i-177"><a id="Page_i-177"></a></span>
which wrought the ill.” Miss Li did as she was told
and put the pills Lien-hsiang gave her one after another
into Sang’s mouth. They burnt his inside like fire; but
soon vitality began to return, and Lien-hsiang cried out,
“He is cured!” Just at this moment Miss Li heard the
cock crow and vanished,<a id="Anchor-151" title="Go to Footnote 151" href="#Footnote-151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Lien-hsiang remaining behind
in attendance on the invalid, who was unable to feed
himself. She bolted the outside door and pretended
that Sang had returned to his native place, so as to
prevent visitors from calling. Day and night she took
care of him, and every evening Miss Li came in to
render assistance, regarding Lien-hsiang as an elder
sister, and being treated by her with great consideration
and kindness. Three months afterwards Sang was as
strong and well as ever he had been, and then for
several evenings Miss Li ceased to visit them, only
staying a few moments when she did come, and seeming
very uneasy in her mind. One evening Sang ran after her
and carried her back in his arms, finding her no heavier
than so much straw; and then, being obliged to stay,
she curled herself up and lay down, to all appearance
<span class="pagenum" title="i-178"><a id="Page_i-178"></a></span>
in a state of unconsciousness, and by-and-by she was
gone. For many days they heard nothing of her, and
Sang was so anxious that she should come back that
he often took out her slipper and shook it. “I don’t
wonder at your missing her,” said Lien-hsiang, “I do
myself very much indeed.” “Formerly,” observed Sang,
“when I shook the slipper she invariably came. I
thought it very strange, but I never suspected her of
being a devil. And now, alas! all I can do is to sit
and think about her with this slipper in my hand.” He
then burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>Now a young lady named Yen-êrh, belonging to the
wealthy Chang family, and about fifteen years of age,
had died suddenly, without any apparent cause, and had
come to life again in the night, when she got up and
wished to go out. They barred the door and would
not hear of her doing so; upon which she said, “I am
the spirit daughter of a petty magistrate. A Mr. Sang
has been very kind to me, and I have left my slipper
at his house. I am really a spirit; what is the use of
keeping me in?” There being some reason for what
she said, they asked her why she had come there; but
she only looked up and down without being able to
give any explanation. Some one here observed, that
Mr. Sang had already gone home, but the young lady
utterly refused to believe them. The family was much disturbed
at all this; and when Sang’s neighbour heard the
story, he jumped over the wall, and peeping through beheld
Sang sitting there chatting with a pretty-looking girl.
As he went in, there was some commotion, during which
<span class="pagenum" title="i-179"><a id="Page_i-179"></a></span>
Sang’s visitor had disappeared, and when his neighbour
asked the meaning of it all, Sang replied, laughing,
“Why, I told you if any ladies came I should ask them
in.” His friend then repeated what Miss Yen-êrh
had said; and Sang, unbolting his door, was about to
go and have a peep at her, but unfortunately had no
means of so doing. Meanwhile Mrs. Chang, hearing
that he had not gone away, was more lost in astonishment
than ever, and sent an old woman-servant to
get back the slipper. Sang immediately gave it to her,
and Miss Yen-êrh was delighted to recover it, though
when she came to try it on it was too small for her
by a good inch. In considerable alarm, she seized
a mirror to look at herself; and suddenly became
aware that she had come to life again in some one
else’s body. She therefore told all to her mother,
and finally succeeded in convincing her, crying all
the time because she was so changed for the worse
as regarded personal appearance from what she had
been before. And whenever she happened to see
Lien-hsiang, she was very much disconcerted, declaring
that she had been much better off as a devil
than now as a human being. She would sit and weep
over the slipper, no one being able to comfort her; and
finally, covering herself up with bed-clothes, she lay
all stark and stiff, positively refusing to take any
nourishment. Her body swelled up, and for seven
days she refused all food, but did not die; and then the
swelling began to subside, and an intense hunger to
come upon her which made her once more think about
<span class="pagenum" title="i-180"><a id="Page_i-180"></a></span>
eating. Then she was troubled with a severe irritation,
and her skin peeled entirely away; and when she got
up in the morning, she found that the shoes had fallen
off. On trying to put them on again, she discovered
that they did not fit her any longer; and then she went
back to her former pair which were now exactly of the
right size and shape. In an ecstasy of joy, she grasped
her mirror, and saw that her features had also changed
back to what they had formerly been; so she washed
and dressed herself and went in to visit her mother.
Every one who met her was much astonished; and when
Lien-hsiang heard the strange story, she tried to persuade
Mr. Sang to make her an offer of marriage. But the
young lady was rich and Sang was poor, and he did
not see his way clearly. However, on Mrs. Chang’s
birthday, when she completed her cycle of sixty-one
years,<a id="Anchor-152" title="Go to Footnote 152" href="#Footnote-152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Sang went along with the others to wish her
many happy returns of the day; and when the old
<span class="pagenum" title="i-181"><a id="Page_i-181"></a></span>
lady knew who was coming, she bade Yen-êrh take
a peep at him from behind the curtain. Sang arrived
last of all; and immediately out rushed Miss Yen-êrh
and seized his sleeve, and said she would go back with
him. Her mother scolded her well for this, and she
ran in abashed; but Sang, who had looked at her
closely, began to weep, and threw himself at the feet
of Mrs. Chang who raised him up without saying
anything unkind. Sang then took his leave, and got
his uncle to act as medium between them; the result
being that an auspicious day was fixed upon for the
wedding. At the appointed time Sang proceeded to
the house to fetch her; and when he returned he found
that, instead of his former poor-looking furniture,
beautiful carpets were laid down from the very door,
and thousands of coloured lanterns were hung about
in elegant designs. Lien-hsiang assisted the bride to
enter, and took off her veil, finding her the same bright
girl as ever. She also joined them while drinking
the wedding cup,<a id="Anchor-153" title="Go to Footnote 153" href="#Footnote-153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and inquired of her friend as to
her recent transmigration; and Yen-êrh related as
follows:&mdash;“Overwhelmed with grief, I began to shrink
<span class="pagenum" title="i-182"><a id="Page_i-182"></a></span>
from myself as some unclean thing; and, after separating
from you that day, I would not return any more to my
grave. So I wandered about at random, and whenever
I saw a living being, I envied its happy state. By
day I remained among trees and shrubs, but at night
I used to roam about anywhere. And once I came to
the house of the Chang family, where, seeing a young
girl lying upon the bed, I took possession of her mortal
coil, unknowing that she would be restored to life
again.” When Lien-hsiang heard this she was for
some time lost in thought; and a month or two afterwards
became very ill. She refused all medical aid and
gradually got worse and worse, to the great grief of
Mr. Sang and his wife, who stood weeping at her bedside.
Suddenly she opened her eyes, and said, “You
wish to live; I am willing to die. If fate so ordains it,
we shall meet again ten years hence.” As she uttered
these words, her spirit passed away, and all that remained
was the dead body of a fox. Sang, however,
insisted on burying it with all the proper ceremonies.</p>

<p>Now his wife had no children; but one day a servant
came in and said, “There is an old woman outside who
has got a little girl for sale.” Sang’s wife gave orders
that she should be shown in; and no sooner had she
set eyes on the girl than she cried out, “Why, she’s the
image of Lien-hsiang!” Sang then looked at her, and
found to his astonishment that she was really very like
his old friend. The old woman said she was fourteen
years old; and when asked what her price was, declared
that her only wish was to get the girl comfortably
<span class="pagenum" title="i-183"><a id="Page_i-183"></a></span>
settled, and enough to keep herself alive, and ensure not
being thrown out into the kennel at death. So Sang
gave a good price for her;<a id="Anchor-154" title="Go to Footnote 154" href="#Footnote-154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> and his wife, taking the
girl’s hand, led her into a room by themselves. Then,
chucking her under the chin, she asked her, smiling,
“Do you know me?” The girl said she did not; after
which she told Mrs. Sang that her name was Wei, and
that her father, who had been a pickle-merchant at
Hsü-ch‘êng, had died three years before. Mrs. Sang
then calculated that Lien-hsiang had been dead just
ten years; and, looking at the girl, who resembled
her so exactly in every trait, at length patted her on
the head, saying, “Ah, my sister, you promised to visit
us again in ten years, and you have not played us false.”
The girl here seemed to wake up as if from a dream,
and, uttering an exclamation of surprise, fixed a steady
<span class="pagenum" title="i-184"><a id="Page_i-184"></a></span>
gaze upon Sang’s wife. Sang himself laughed, and said,
“Just like the return of an old familiar swallow.”
“Now I understand,” cried the girl, in tears; “I recollect
my mother saying that when I was born I was able
to speak; and that, thinking it an inauspicious manifestation,
they gave me dog’s blood to drink, so that
I should forget all about my previous state of existence.<a id="Anchor-155" title="Go to Footnote 155" href="#Footnote-155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
Is it all a dream, or are you not the Miss Li who
was so ashamed of being a devil?” Thus they chatted
of their existence in a former life, with alternate tears
and smiles; but when it came to the day for worshipping
at the tombs, Yen-êrh explained that she and her
husband were in the habit of annually visiting and
mourning over her grave. The girl replied that she
would accompany them; and when they got there
they found the whole place in disorder, and the coffin
wood all warped. “Lien-hsiang and I,” said Yen-êrh
to her husband, “have been attached to each other in
two states of existence. Let us not be separated, but
bury my bones here with hers.” Sang consented, and
opening Miss Li’s tomb, took out the bones and buried
them with those of Lien-hsiang, while friends and
relatives, who had heard the strange story, gathered
round the grave in gala dress to the number of many
hundreds.</p>

<p>I learnt the above when travelling through I-chou,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-185"><a id="Page_i-185"></a></span>
where I was detained at an inn by rain, and read a
biography of Mr. Sang written by a comrade of his
named Wang Tzŭ-chang. It was lent me by a Mr. Liu
Tzŭ-ching, a relative of Sang’s, and was quite a long
account. This is merely an outline of it.</p>

<h2><a id="chapter-24"><abbr title="Twenty-Four">XXIV.</abbr>
<br/>
MISS A-PAO; OR, PERSEVERANCE
REWARDED.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">In</span> the province of Kuang-si there lived a scholar of
some reputation, named Sun Tzŭ-ch‘u. He was born
with six fingers, and such a simple fellow was he that he
readily believed any nonsense he was told. Very shy
with the fair sex, the sight of a woman was enough to
send him flying in the opposite direction; and once
when he was inveigled into a room where there were
some young ladies, he blushed down to his neck and the
perspiration dripped off him like falling pearls. His
companions laughed heartily at his discomfiture, and
told fine stories of what a noodle he looked, so that he
got the nickname of Silly Sun.</p>

<p>In the town where our hero resided, there was a rich
trader whose wealth equalled that of any prince or
nobleman, and whose connections were all highly aristocratic.<a id="Anchor-156" title="Go to Footnote 156" href="#Footnote-156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
He had a daughter, A-pao, of great beauty, for
<span class="pagenum" title="i-187"><a id="Page_i-187"></a></span>
whom he was seeking a husband; and the young men of
position in the neighbourhood were vying with each
other to obtain her hand, but none of them met with
the father’s approval. Now Silly Sun had recently lost
his wife; and some one in joke persuaded him to try his
luck and send in an application. Sun, who had no idea
of his own shortcomings, proceeded at once to follow this
advice; but the father, though he knew him to be an
accomplished scholar, rejected his suit on the ground of
poverty. As the go-between<a id="Anchor-157" title="Go to Footnote 157" href="#Footnote-157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> was leaving the house, she
chanced to meet A-pao, and related to her the object of
her visit. “Tell him,” cried A-pao, laughing, “that if
he’ll cut off his extra finger, I’ll marry him.” The old
woman reported this to Sun, who replied, “That is not
very difficult;” and, seizing a chopper, cut the finger
clean off. The wound was extremely painful and he lost
so much blood that he nearly died, it being many days
before he was about again. He then sought out the
go-between, and bade her inform Miss A-pao, which she
did; and A-pao was taken rather aback, but she told the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-188"><a id="Page_i-188"></a></span>
old woman to go once more and bid him cut off the
“silly” from his reputation. Sun got much excited
when he heard this, and denied that he was silly; however,
as he was unable to prove it to the young lady herself,
he began to think that probably her beauty was
over-stated, and that she was giving herself great airs.
So he ceased to trouble himself about her until the
following spring festival,<a id="Anchor-158" title="Go to Footnote 158" href="#Footnote-158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> when it was customary for both
men and women to be seen abroad, and the young rips
of the place would stroll about in groups and pass their
remarks on all and sundry. Sun’s friends urged him to
join them in their expedition, and one of them asked
him with a smile if he did not wish to look out for a
suitable mate. Sun knew they were chaffing him, but he
thought he should like to see the girl that had made
such a fool of him, and was only too pleased to accompany
them. They soon perceived a young lady resting
herself under a tree, with a throng of young fellows
crowding round her, and they immediately determined
that she must be A-pao, as in fact they found she was.
Possessed of peerless beauty, the ring of her admirers
gradually increased, till at last she rose up to go. The
excitement among the young men was intense; they
criticised her face and discussed her feet,<a id="Anchor-159" title="Go to Footnote 159" href="#Footnote-159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Sun only
<span class="pagenum" title="i-189"><a id="Page_i-189"></a></span>
remaining silent; and when they had passed on to something
else, there they saw Sun rooted like an imbecile
to the same spot. As he made no answer when spoken
to, they dragged him along with them, saying, “Has
your spirit run away after A-pao?” He made no reply
to this either; but they thought nothing of that, knowing
his usual strangeness of manner, so by dint of pushing
and pulling they managed to get him home. There he
threw himself on the bed and did not get up again for
the rest of the day, lying in a state of unconsciousness
just as if he were drunk. He did not wake when called;
and his people, thinking that his spirit had fled, went
about in the fields calling out to it to return.<a id="Anchor-160" title="Go to Footnote 160" href="#Footnote-160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> However,
he shewed no signs of improvement; and when they
shook him, and asked him what was the matter, he only
answered in a sleepy kind of voice, “I am at A-pao’s
house;” but to further questions he would not make
any reply, and left his family in a state of keen suspense.</p>

<p>Now when Silly Sun had seen the young lady get up
to go, he could not bear to part with her, and found
himself first following and then walking along by her
side without anyone saying anything to him. Thus he
went back with her to her home, and there he remained
for three days, longing to run home and get something
to eat, but unfortunately not knowing the way. By that
<span class="pagenum" title="i-190"><a id="Page_i-190"></a></span>
time Sun had hardly a breath left in him; and his
friends, fearing that he was going to die, sent to beg of
the rich trader that he would allow a search to be made
for Sun’s spirit in his house. The trader laughed and
said, “He wasn’t in the habit of coming here, so he
could hardly have left his spirit behind him;” but he
yielded to the entreaties of Sun’s family, and permitted
the search to be made. Thereupon a magician proceeded
to the house, taking with him an old suit of
Sun’s clothes and some grass matting; and when Miss
A-pao heard the reason for which he had come, she
simplified matters very much by leading the magician
straight to her own room. The magician summoned the
spirit in due form, and went back towards Sun’s house.
By the time he had reached the door, Sun groaned and
recovered consciousness; and he was then able to
describe all the articles of toilette and furniture in
A-pao’s room without making a single mistake. A-pao
was amazed when the story was repeated to her, and
could not help feeling kindly towards him on account of
the depth of his passion. Sun himself, when he got
well enough to leave his bed, would often sit in a state
of abstraction as if he had lost his wits; and he was for
ever scheming to try and have another glimpse at A-pao.</p>

<p>One day he heard that she intended to worship at the
Shui-yüeh temple on the 8th of the fourth moon, that
day being the Wash-Buddha festival; and he set off
early in the morning to wait for her at the roadside. He
was nearly blind with straining his eyes, and the sun was
already past noontide before the young lady arrived; but
<span class="pagenum" title="i-191"><a id="Page_i-191"></a></span>
when she saw from her carriage a gentleman standing
there, she drew aside the screen and had a good stare at
him. Sun followed her in a great state of excitement,
upon which she bade one of her maids to go and ask his
name. Sun told her who he was, his perturbation all
the time increasing; and when the carriage drove on he
returned home. Again he became very ill, and lay on
his bed unconscious, without taking any food, occasionally
calling on A-pao by name, at the same time
abusing his spirit for not having been able to follow her
as before. Just at this juncture a parrot that had been
long with the family died; and a child, playing with the
body, laid it upon the bed. Sun then reflected that if he
was only a parrot one flap of his wings would bring him
into the presence of A-pao; and while occupied with
these thoughts, lo! the dead body moved and the
parrot flew away. It flew straight to A-pao’s room, at
which she was delighted; and catching it, tied a string
to its leg, and fed it upon hemp-seed. “Dear sister,”
cried the bird, “do not tie me by the leg: I am Sun
Tzŭ-ch‘u.” In great alarm A-pao untied the string, but
the parrot did not fly away. “Alas!” said she, “your
love has engraved itself upon my heart; but now you
are no longer a man, how shall we ever be united
together?” “To be near your dear self,” replied the
parrot, “is all I care about.” The parrot then refused
to take food from anyone else, and kept close to Miss
A-pao wherever she went, day and night alike. At the
expiration of three days, A-pao, who had grown very
fond of her parrot, secretly sent some one to ask how
<span class="pagenum" title="i-192"><a id="Page_i-192"></a></span>
Mr. Sun was; but he had already been dead three days,
though the part over his heart had not grown cold.
“Oh! come to life again as a man,” cried the young
lady, “and I swear to be yours for ever.” “You are
surely not in earnest,” said the parrot, “are you?”
Miss A-pao declared she was, and the parrot, cocking its
head aside, remained some time as if absorbed in
thought. By-and-by A-pao took off her shoes to bind
her feet a little tighter;<a id="Anchor-161" title="Go to Footnote 161" href="#Footnote-161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and the parrot, making a rapid
grab at one, flew off with it in its beak. She called
loudly after it to come back, but in a moment it was out
of sight; so she next sent a servant to inquire if there
was any news of Mr. Sun, and then learnt that he had
come round again, the parrot having flown in with an
embroidered shoe and dropped down dead on the
ground. Also, that directly he regained consciousness
he asked for the shoe, of which his people knew nothing;
at which moment her servant had arrived, and demanded
to know from him where it was. “It was given to me
by Miss A-pao as a pledge of faith,” replied Sun; “I
beg you will tell her I have not forgotten her promise.”
A-pao was greatly astonished at this, and instructed her
maid to divulge the whole affair to her mother, who,
when she had made some inquiries, observed that Sun
was well known as a clever fellow, but was desperately
poor, and “to get such a son-in-law after all our trouble
<span class="pagenum" title="i-193"><a id="Page_i-193"></a></span>
would give our aristocratic friends the laugh against us.”<a id="Anchor-162" title="Go to Footnote 162" href="#Footnote-162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
However, A-pao pleaded that with the shoe there as a
proof against her, she would not marry anybody else;
and, ultimately, her father and mother gave their consent.
This was immediately announced to Mr. Sun, whose
illness rapidly disappeared in consequence. A-pao’s
father would have had Sun come and live with them;<a id="Anchor-163" title="Go to Footnote 163" href="#Footnote-163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
but the young lady objected, on the score that a son-in-law
should not remain long at a time with the family of
his wife,<a id="Anchor-164" title="Go to Footnote 164" href="#Footnote-164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and that as he was poor he would lower himself
still more by doing so. “I have accepted him,”
added she, “and I shall gladly reside in his humble
cottage, and share his poor fare without complaint.”
The marriage was then celebrated, and bride and bridegroom
met as if for the first time in their lives.<a id="Anchor-165" title="Go to Footnote 165" href="#Footnote-165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The
dowry A-pao brought with her somewhat raised their
pecuniary position, and gave them a certain amount of
<span class="pagenum" title="i-194"><a id="Page_i-194"></a></span>
comfort; but Sun himself stuck only to his books, and
knew nothing about managing affairs in general. Luckily
his wife was clever in that respect, and did not bother
him with such things; so much so that by the end of
three years they were comparatively well off, when Sun
suddenly fell ill and died. Mrs. Sun was inconsolable,
and refused either to sleep or take nourishment, being
deaf to all entreaties on the subject; and before long,
taking advantage of the night, she hanged herself.<a id="Anchor-166" title="Go to Footnote 166" href="#Footnote-166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Her
maid, hearing a noise, ran in and cut her down just in
time: but she still steadily refused all food. Three days
passed away, and the friends and relatives of Sun came
to attend his funeral, when suddenly they heard a sigh
proceeding forth from the coffin. The coffin was then
opened and they found that Sun had come to life again.
He told them that he had been before the Great Judge,
who, as a reward for his upright and honourable life,
had conferred upon him an official appointment. “At
this moment,” said Sun, “it was reported that my wife
was close at hand,<a id="Anchor-167" title="Go to Footnote 167" href="#Footnote-167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> but the Judge, referring to the
register, observed that her time had not yet come. They
told him she had taken no food for three days; and then
the Judge, looking at me, said that as a recompense for
her wifely virtues she should be permitted to return to
life. Thereupon he gave orders to his attendants to put
to the horses and see us safely back.” From that hour
<span class="pagenum" title="i-195"><a id="Page_i-195"></a></span>
Sun gradually improved, and the next year went up for
his master’s degree. All his old companions chaffed
him exceedingly before the examination, and gave him
seven themes on out-of-the-way subjects, telling him
privately that they had been surreptitiously obtained
from the examiners. Sun believed them as usual, and
worked at them day and night until he was perfect, his
comrades all the time enjoying a good laugh against him.
However, when the day came it was found that the
examiners, fearing lest the themes they had chosen in
an ordinary way should have been dishonestly made
public,<a id="Anchor-168" title="Go to Footnote 168" href="#Footnote-168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> took a set of fresh ones quite out of the
common run&mdash;in fact, on the very subjects Sun’s companions
had given to him. Consequently, he came out
at the head of the list; and the next year, after taking
his doctor’s degree, he was entered among the Han-lin
Academicians.<a id="Anchor-169" title="Go to Footnote 169" href="#Footnote-169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The Emperor, too, happening to hear
of his curious adventures, sent for him and made him
repeat his story; subsequently, summoning A-pao and
making her some very costly presents.</p>

JEN HSIU.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Jen Chien-chih</span> was a native of Yü-t‘ai, and a dealer
in rugs and furs. One day he set off for Shensi, taking
with him every penny he could scrape together; and on
the road he met a man who told him that his name was
Shên Chu-t‘ing, and his native place Su-ch‘ien. These
two soon became firm friends, and entered into a
masonic bond<a id="Anchor-170" title="Go to Footnote 170" href="#Footnote-170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> with each other, journeying on together
by the same stages until they reached their destination.
By-and-by Mr. Jen fell sick, and his companion had to
nurse him, which he did with the utmost attention, but
<span class="pagenum" title="i-197"><a id="Page_i-197"></a></span>
for ten days he gradually got worse and worse, and at
length said to Shên, “My family is very poor. Eight
mouths depend upon my exertions for food; and now,
alas! I am about to die, far from my own home. You
and I are brothers. At this distance there is no one
else to whom I can look. Now in my purse you will
find two hundred ounces of silver. Take half, and
when you have defrayed my funeral expenses, use the
balance for your return journey; and give the other half
to my family, that they may be able to send for my
coffin.<a id="Anchor-171" title="Go to Footnote 171" href="#Footnote-171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> If, however, you will take my mortal remains
with you home to my native place, these expenses need
not be incurred.” He then, with the aid of a pillow,
wrote a letter, which he handed to Shên, and that evening
he died. Thereupon Shên purchased a cheap
coffin<a id="Anchor-172" title="Go to Footnote 172" href="#Footnote-172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> for some five or six ounces of silver; and, as the
landlord kept urging him to take away the body, he said
he would go out and seek for a temple where it might
<span class="pagenum" title="i-198"><a id="Page_i-198"></a></span>
be temporarily deposited. But he ran away and never
went back to the inn; and it was more than a year
before Jen’s family knew what had taken place. His
son was just about seventeen years of age, and had
recently been reading with a tutor; but now his books
were laid aside, and he proposed to go in search of his
father’s body. His mother said he was too young; and
it was only when he declared he would rather not live
than stay at home, that with the aid of the pawn-shop<a id="Anchor-173" title="Go to Footnote 173" href="#Footnote-173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
enough money was raised to start him on his way. An
old servant accompanied him, and it was six months
before they returned and performed the last ceremonies
over Jen’s remains. The family was thus reduced to
absolute destitution; but happily young Hsiu was a
<span class="pagenum" title="i-199"><a id="Page_i-199"></a></span>
clever fellow, and when the days of mourning<a id="Anchor-174" title="Go to Footnote 174" href="#Footnote-174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> were
over, took his bachelor’s degree. On the other hand, he
was somewhat wild and very fond of gambling; and
although his mother strictly prohibited such diversions,
all her prohibitions were in vain. By-and-by the Grand
Examiner arrived, and Hsiu came out in the fourth class.
His mother was extremely angry, and refused to take
food, which brought young Hsiu to his senses, and he
promised her faithfully he would never gamble again.
From that day he shut himself up, and the following
year took a first class degree, coming out among the
“senior” graduates.<a id="Anchor-175" title="Go to Footnote 175" href="#Footnote-175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> His mother now advised him to
take pupils, but his reputation as a disorderly fellow
stuck to him, and no one would entrust their sons to his
care.</p>

<p>Just then an uncle of his, named Chang, was about to
start with merchandise for the capital, and recommended
that Hsiu should go along with him, promising himself to
pay all expenses, an offer which Hsiu was only too pleased
to accept. When they reached Lin-ch‘ing, they anchored
outside the Custom House, where they found a great
number of salt-junks, in fact a perfect forest of masts;
and what with the noise of the water and the people it
<span class="pagenum" title="i-200"><a id="Page_i-200"></a></span>
was quite impossible to sleep. Besides, as the row was
beginning to subside, the clear rattle of dice from a
neighbouring boat fell upon Hsiu’s ear, and before long
he was itching to be back again at his old games.
Listening to hear if all around him were sound asleep,
he drew forth a string of cash that he had brought with
him, and thought he would just go across and try his
luck. So he got up quietly with his money, and was on
the point of going, when he suddenly recollected his
mother’s injunctions, and at once tying his purse-strings
laid himself down to sleep. He was far too excited,
however, to close his eyes; and after a while got up
again and re-opened his purse. This he did three times,
until at last it was too much for him, and off he went
with his money. Crossing over into the boat whence
the sounds proceeded, he beheld two persons engaged in
gambling for high stakes; so throwing his money on the
table, he begged to be allowed to join. The others
readily consented, and they began to play, Hsiu winning
so rapidly that soon one of the strangers had no money
left, and was obliged to get the proprietor of the boat to
change a large piece of silver for him, proceeding to lay
down as much as several ounces of silver for a single
stake.</p>

<p>As the play was in full swing another man walked
in, who after watching for some time at length got the
proprietor to change another lump of silver for him
of one hundred ounces in weight, and also asked to
be allowed to join. Now Hsiu’s uncle, waking up in the
middle of the night, and finding his nephew gone, and
<span class="pagenum" title="i-201"><a id="Page_i-201"></a></span>
hearing the sound of dice-throwing hard by, knew at
once where he was, and immediately followed him to the
boat with a view of bringing him back. Finding, however,
that Hsiu was a heavy winner, he said nothing to
him, only carrying off a portion of his winnings to their
own boat and making the others of his party get up and
help him to fetch the rest, even then leaving behind a
large sum for Hsiu to go on with. By-and-by the three
strangers had lost all their ready money, and there wasn’t
a farthing left in the boat: upon which one of them
proposed to play for lumps of silver, but Hsiu said he
never went so high as that. This made them a little
quarrelsome, Hsiu’s uncle all the time trying to get him
away; and the proprietor of the boat, who had only his
own commission in view, managed to borrow some
hundred strings of cash from another boat, and started
them all again. Hsiu soon took this out of them; and,
as day was beginning to dawn and the Custom House
was about to open, he went off with his winnings back to
his own boat.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the gambling-boat now found that
the lumps of silver which he had changed for his
customers were nothing more than so much tinsel, and
rushing off in a great state of alarm to Hsiu’s boat,
told him what had happened and asked him to make it
good; but when he discovered he was speaking to the
son of his former travelling companion, Jen Chien-chih,
he hung his head and slunk away covered with shame.
For the proprietor of that boat was no other than Shên
Chu-t‘ing, of whom Hsiu had heard when he was in
<span class="pagenum" title="i-202"><a id="Page_i-202"></a></span>
Shensi; now, however, that with supernatural aid<a id="Anchor-176" title="Go to Footnote 176" href="#Footnote-176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> the
wrongs of his father had been avenged, he determined
to pursue the man no further. So going into partnership
with his uncle, they proceeded north together; and by
the end of the year their capital had increased five-fold.
Hsiu then purchased the status of <i>chien-shêng</i>,<a id="Anchor-177" title="Go to Footnote 177" href="#Footnote-177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> and by
further careful investment of his money ultimately
became the richest man in that part of the country.</p>

<br/>
THE LOST BROTHER.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">In</span> Honan there lived a man named Chang, who
originally belonged to Shantung. His wife had been
seized and carried off by the soldiery during the period
when Ching Nan’s troops were overrunning the latter
province;<a id="Anchor-178" title="Go to Footnote 178" href="#Footnote-178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> and as he was frequently in Honan on business,
he finally settled there and married a Honan wife,
by whom he had a son named Na. By-and-by this wife
died, and he took another, who bore him a son named
Ch‘êng. The last-mentioned lady was from the Niu
family, and a very malicious woman. So jealous was
she of Na, that she treated him like a slave or a beast of
the field, giving him only the coarsest food, and making
him cut a large bundle of wood every day, in default of
which she would beat and abuse him in a most shameful
manner. On the other hand she secretly reserved all
the tit-bits for Ch‘êng, and also sent him to school. As
Ch‘êng grew up, and began to understand the meaning
of filial piety and fraternal love,<a id="Anchor-179" title="Go to Footnote 179" href="#Footnote-179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> he could not bear to
see this treatment of his elder brother, and spoke privately
<span class="pagenum" title="i-204"><a id="Page_i-204"></a></span>
to his mother about it; but she would pay no
heed to what he said.</p>

<p>One day, when Na was on the hills performing his
task, a violent storm came on, and he took shelter under
a cliff. However, by the time it was over the sun had
set, and he began to feel very hungry. So, shouldering
his bundle, he wended his way home, where his step-mother,
displeased with the small quantity of wood he
had brought, refused to give him anything to eat. Quite
overcome with hunger, Na went in and lay down; and
when Ch‘êng came back from school, and saw the state
he was in, he asked him if he was ill. Na replied that
he was only hungry, and then told his brother the whole
story; whereupon Ch‘êng coloured up and went away,
returning shortly with some cakes, which he offered to
Na. “Where did you get them?” asked the latter.
“Oh,” replied Ch‘êng, “I stole some flour and got a
neighbour’s wife to make them for me. Eat away, and
don’t talk.” Na ate them up; but begged his brother
not to do this again, as he might get himself into
trouble. “I shan’t die,” added he, “if I only get one
meal a-day.” “You are not strong,” rejoined Ch‘êng,
“and shouldn’t cut so much wood as you do.”</p>

<p>Next day, after breakfast, Ch‘êng slipped away to the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-205"><a id="Page_i-205"></a></span>
hills, and arrived at the place where Na was occupied
with his usual task, to the great astonishment of the
latter, who inquired what he was going to do. “To
help you cut wood,” replied Ch‘êng. “And who sent
you?” asked his brother. “No one,” said he; “I came
of my own accord.” “Ah,” cried Na, “you can’t do
this work; and even if you can you must not. Run
along home again.” Ch‘êng, however, remained, aiding
his brother with his hands and feet alone, but declaring
that on the morrow he would bring an axe. Na tried to
stop him, and found that he had already hurt his finger
and worn his shoes into holes; so he began to cry, and
said, “If you don’t go home directly, I’ll kill myself
with my axe.” Ch‘êng then went away, his brother
seeing him half-way home, and going back to finish his
work by himself. He also called in the evening at
Ch‘êng’s school, and told the master his brother was a
delicate boy, and should not be allowed to go on the
hills, where, he said, there were fierce tigers and wolves.
The master replied that he didn’t know where Ch‘êng
had been all the morning, but that he had caned him for
playing truant. Na further pointed out to Ch‘êng that
by not doing as he had told him, he had let himself in
for a beating. Ch‘êng laughed, and said he hadn’t been
beaten; and the very next day off he went again, and
this time with a hatchet. “I told you not to come,”
cried Na, much alarmed; “why have you done so?”
Ch‘êng made no reply, but set to work chopping wood
with such energy that the perspiration poured down his
face; and when he had cut about a bundle he went
<span class="pagenum" title="i-206"><a id="Page_i-206"></a></span>
away without saying a word. The master caned him
again, and then Ch‘êng told him how the matter stood,
at which the former became full of admiration for his
pupil’s kind behaviour, and no longer prevented him
from going. His brother, however, frequently urged
him not to come, though without the slightest success;
and one day, when they went with a number of others to
cut wood, a tiger rushed down from the hills upon them.
The wood-cutters hid themselves, in the greatest consternation;
and the tiger, seizing Ch‘êng, ran off with
him in his mouth. Ch‘êng’s weight caused the tiger to
move slowly; and Na, rushing after them, hacked away
at the tiger’s flanks with his axe. The pain only made
the tiger hurry off, and in a few minutes they were out
of sight. Overwhelmed with grief, Na went back to his
comrades, who tried to soothe him; but he said, “My
brother was no ordinary brother, and, besides, he died
for me; why, then, should I live?” Here, seizing his
hatchet, he made a great chop at his own neck, upon
which his companions prevented him from doing himself
any more mischief. The wound, however, was over an
inch deep, and blood was flowing so copiously that Na
became faint, and seemed at the point of death. They
then tore up their clothes, and, after having bandaged
his neck, proceeded to carry him home. His step-mother
cried bitterly, and cursed him, saying, “You
have killed my son, and now you go and cut your neck
in this make-believe kind of way.” “Don’t be angry,
mother,” replied Na; “I will not live now that my
brother is dead.” He then threw himself on the bed;
<span class="pagenum" title="i-207"><a id="Page_i-207"></a></span>
but the pain of his wound was so great he could not
sleep, and day and night he sat leaning against the wall
in tears. His father, fearing that he too would die, went
every now and then and gave him a little nourishment;
but his wife cursed him so for doing it, that at length Na
refused all food, and in three days he died.</p>

<p>Now in the village where these events took place there
was a magician who was employed in certain devil-work
among mortals,<a id="Anchor-180" title="Go to Footnote 180" href="#Footnote-180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and Na’s ghost, happening to fall in
with him, related the story of its previous sorrows,
winding up by asking where his brother’s ghost was.
The magician said he didn’t know, but turned round
with Na and shewed him the way to a city where they
saw an official servant coming out of the city gates.
The magician stopped him, and inquired if he could
tell them anything about Ch‘êng; whereupon the man
drew out a list from a pouch at his side, and, after carefully
examining it, replied that among the male and
female criminals within there was no one of the name of
Chang.<a id="Anchor-181" title="Go to Footnote 181" href="#Footnote-181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The magician here suggested that the name
might be on another list; but the man replied that he
was in charge of that road, and surely ought to know.
Na, however, was not satisfied, and persuaded the
magician to enter the city, where they met many new
<span class="pagenum" title="i-208"><a id="Page_i-208"></a></span>
and old devils walking about, among whom were some
Na had formerly known in life. So he asked them if
they could direct him to his brother but none of them
knew where he was; and suddenly there was a great
commotion, the devils on all sides crying out, “P‘u-sa<a id="Anchor-182" title="Go to Footnote 182" href="#Footnote-182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
has come!” Then, looking up, Na beheld a most
beautiful man descending from above, encircled by
rays of glory, which shot forth above and below, lighting
up all around him. “You are in luck’s way, Sir,”
said the magician to Na; “only once in many thousand
years does P‘u-sa descend into hell and banish all
suffering. He has come to-day.” He then made Na
kneel, and all the devils began with clasped hands to
sing songs of praise to P‘u-sa for his compassion in
releasing them from their misery, shaking the very earth
with the sound. P‘u-sa himself, seizing a willow-branch,
sprinkled them all with holy water; and when this was
done the clouds and glory melted away, and he vanished
from their sight. Na, who had felt the holy water fall
upon his neck, now became conscious that the axe-wound
was no longer painful; and the magician then
proceeded to lead him back, not quitting him until
within sight of the village gate. In fact, Na had been
in a trance for two days, and when he recovered he told
them all that he had seen, asserting positively that
Ch‘êng was not dead. His mother, however, looked
<span class="pagenum" title="i-209"><a id="Page_i-209"></a></span>
upon the story as a make-up, and never ceased reviling
him; and, as he had no means of proving his innocence,
and his neck was now quite healed, he got up from the
bed and said to his father, “I am going away to seek for
my brother throughout the universe; if I do not find him,
never expect to see me again, but I pray you regard me
as dead.” His father drew him aside and wept bitterly.
However, he would not interfere with his son’s design,
and Na accordingly set off. Whenever he came to a
large town or populous place he used to ask for news of
Ch‘êng; and by-and-by, when his money was all spent,
he begged his way on foot. A year had passed away
before he reached Nanking, and his clothes were all in
tatters as ragged as a quail’s tail,<a id="Anchor-183" title="Go to Footnote 183" href="#Footnote-183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> when suddenly he
met some ten or a dozen horsemen, and drew away to
the roadside. Among them was a gentleman of about
forty, who appeared to be a mandarin, with numerous
lusty attendants and fiery steeds accompanying him before
and behind. One young man on a small palfrey,
whom Na took to be the mandarin’s son, and at whom,
of course, he did not venture to stare, eyed him closely
for some time, and at length stopped his steed, and,
jumping off, cried out, “Are you not my brother?” Na
then raised his head, and found that Ch‘êng stood before
him. Grasping each other’s hands, the brothers burst
into tears, and at length Ch‘êng said, “My brother, how
is it you have strayed so far as this?” Na told him the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-210"><a id="Page_i-210"></a></span>
circumstances, at which he was much affected; and
Ch‘êng’s companions, jumping off their horses to see
what was the matter, went off and informed the mandarin.
The latter ordered one of them to give up his
horse to Na, and thus they rode together back to the
mandarin’s house. Ch‘êng then told his brother how
the tiger had carried him away, and how he had been
thrown down in the road, where he had passed a whole
night; also how the mandarin, Mr. Chang,<a id="Anchor-184" title="Go to Footnote 184" href="#Footnote-184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> on his return
from the capital, had seen him there, and, observing that
he was no common-looking youth, had set to work and
brought him round again. Also how he had said to Mr.
Chang that his home was a great way off, and how Mr.
Chang had taken him to his own home, and finally
cured him of his wounds; when, having no son of his
own, he had adopted him. And now, happening to be
out with his father, he had caught sight of his brother.
As he was speaking Mr. Chang walked in, and Na
thanked him very heartily for all his kindness; Ch‘êng,
meanwhile, going into the inner apartments to get some
clothes for his brother. Wine and food was placed on
the table; and while they were chatting together the
mandarin asked Na about the number of their family in
Honan. “There is only my father,” replied Na, “and
he is a Shantung man who came to live in Honan.”
“Why, I am a Shantung man too,” rejoined Mr. Chang;
<span class="pagenum" title="i-211"><a id="Page_i-211"></a></span>
“what is the name of your father’s native place?” “I
have heard that it was in the Tung-ch‘ang district,” replied
Na. “Then we are from the same place,” cried
the mandarin. “Why did your father go away to
Honan?” “His first wife,” said Na, “was carried off
by soldiers, and my father lost everything he possessed;
so, being in the habit of trading to Honan, he determined
to settle down there for good.” The mandarin
then asked what his father’s other name was, and when
he heard, he sat some time staring at Na, and at length
hurried away within. In a few moments out came an
old lady, and when they had all bowed to her, she asked
Na if he was Chang Ping-chih’s grandson. On his replying
in the affirmative, the old lady wept, and, turning to
Mr. Chang, said, “These two are your younger brothers.”
And then she explained to Na and Ch‘êng as
follows:&mdash;“Three years after my marriage with your
father, I was carried off to the north and made a slave<a id="Anchor-185" title="Go to Footnote 185" href="#Footnote-185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
<span class="pagenum" title="i-212"><a id="Page_i-212"></a></span>
in a mandarin’s family. Six months afterwards your
elder brother here was born, and in another six months
the mandarin died. Your elder brother being his heir,
he received this appointment, which he is now resigning.
I have often thought of my native place, and have not
unfrequently sent people to inquire about my husband,
giving them the full particulars as to name and clan; but
I could never hear anything of him. How should I
know that he had gone to Honan?” Then, addressing
Mr. Chang, she continued, “That was rather a mistake
of yours, adopting your own brother.” “He never told
me anything about Shantung,” replied Mr. Chang; “I
suppose he was too young to remember the story; and I
only looked at the difference between our ages.” For
he, the elder of the brothers, was forty-one; Ch‘êng, the
younger, being only sixteen; and Na, twenty years of
age. Mr. Chang was very glad to get two young
brothers; and when he heard the tale of their separation,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-213"><a id="Page_i-213"></a></span>
proposed that they should all go back to their
father. Mrs. Chang was afraid her husband would not
care to receive her back again; but her eldest son said,
“We will cast our lot together; all or none. How can
there be a country where fathers are not valued?” They
then sold their house and packed up, and were soon on
the way to Honan. When they arrived, Ch‘êng went in
first to tell his father, whose third wife had died since Na
left, and who now was a desolate old widower, left alone
with only his own shadow. He was overjoyed to see
Ch‘êng again, and, looking fondly at his son, burst into
a flood of tears. Ch‘êng told him his mother and
brothers were outside, and the old man was then perfectly
transfixed with astonishment, unable either to
laugh or to cry. Mr. Chang next appeared, followed by
his mother; and the two old people wept in each other’s
arms, the late solitary widower hardly knowing what to
make of the crowd of men and women-servants that
suddenly filled his house. Here Ch‘êng, not seeing his
own mother, asked where she was; and when he heard
she was dead, he fainted away, and did not come round
for a good half-hour. Mr. Chang found the money for
building a fine house, and engaged a tutor for his two
brothers. Horses pranced in the stables, and servants
chattered in the hall&mdash;it was quite a large establishment.</p>

THE THREE GENII.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">There</span> was a certain scholar who, passing through
Su-ch‘ien on his way to Nanking, where he was going to
try for his master’s degree, happened to fall in with three
other gentlemen, all graduates like himself, and was so
charmed with their unusual refinement that he purchased
a quantity of wine, and begged them to join him
in drinking it. While thus pleasantly employed, his
three friends told him their names. One was Chieh
Ch‘in-hêng; the second, Ch‘ang Fêng-lin; and the other,
Ma Hsi-ch‘ih. They drank away and enjoyed themselves
very much, until evening had crept upon them
unperceived, when Chieh said, “Here we, who ought to
have been playing the host, have been feasting at a
stranger’s expense. This is not right. But, come, my
house is close by; I will provide you with a bed.”
Ch‘ang and Ma got up, and, taking our hero by the arm,
bade his servant come along with them. When they
reached a hill to the north of the village, there before
them was a house and grounds, with a stream of clear
water in front of the door, all the apartments within
being beautifully clean and nice. Chieh then gave
<span class="pagenum" title="i-215"><a id="Page_i-215"></a></span>
orders to light the lamps and see after his visitor’s
servant; whereupon Ma observed, “Of old it was customary
to set intellectual refreshments before one’s
friends; let us not miss the opportunity of this lovely
evening, but decide on four themes, one for each of us;
and then, when we have finished our essays, we can set
to work on the wine.”<a id="Anchor-186" title="Go to Footnote 186" href="#Footnote-186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> To this the others readily
agreed; and each wrote down a theme and threw it on
the table. These were next divided amongst them as
they sat, and before the second watch<a id="Anchor-187" title="Go to Footnote 187" href="#Footnote-187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> was over the
essays were all completed and handed round for general
inspection; and our scholar was so struck with the elegance
and vigour of those by his three friends, that he
ran off a copy of them and put it in his pocket. The
host then produced some excellent wine, which was
drunk by them in such bumpers that soon they were
all tolerably tipsy. The other two now took their leave;
but Chieh led the scholar into another room, where, so
overcome was he with wine, that he went to bed in his
boots and clothes.</p>

<p>The sun was high in the heavens when our hero
awaked, and, looking round, he saw no house or
<span class="pagenum" title="i-216"><a id="Page_i-216"></a></span>
grounds, only a dell on the hill-side, in which he and
his servant had been sleeping. In great alarm he called
out to the servant, who also got up, and then they found
a hole with a rill of water trickling down before it.
Much astonished at all this, he felt in his pocket, and
there, sure enough, was the paper on which he had
copied the three essays of his friends. On descending
the hill and making inquiries, he found that he had been
to the Grotto of the Three Genii&mdash;namely, Crab, Snake,
and Frog, three very wonderful beings, who often came
out for a stroll, and were occasionally visible to mortal
eyes. Subsequently, when our hero entered the examination
hall, lo! the three themes set were those of the
Three Genii, and he came out at the top of the list.</p>

THE SINGING FROGS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Wang Tzŭ-sun</span> told me that when he was at the
capital he saw a man in the street who gave the
following performance:&mdash;He had a wooden box, divided
by partitions into twelve holes, in each of which was a
frog; and whenever he tapped any one of these frogs
on the head with a tiny wand, the frog so touched would
immediately begin to sing. Some one gave him a piece

THE PERFORMING MICE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Wang</span> also told me that there was a man at
Ch‘ang-an who made his living by exhibiting performing
mice. He had a pouch on his back in which he kept
some ten of these little animals; and whenever he got
among a number of people he would fix a little frame on
his back, exactly resembling a stage. Then beating a
drum he would sing some old theatrical melody, at the
first sounds of which the mice would issue forth from
the pouch, and then, with masks on their faces, and
arrayed in various costumes, they would climb up his
back on to the stage, where standing on their hind-legs
they would go through a performance portraying the
various emotions of joy and anger, exactly like human
actors of either sex.<a id="Anchor-188" title="Go to Footnote 188" href="#Footnote-188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<br/>
THE TIGER OF CHAO-CH‘ÊNG.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Chao-ch‘êng there lived an old woman more than
seventy years of age, who had an only son. One day
he went up to the hills and was eaten by a tiger, at
which his mother was so overwhelmed with grief that
she hardly wished to live. With tears and lamentations
she ran and told her story to the magistrate of the
place, who laughed and asked her how she thought the
law could be brought to bear on a tiger. But the old
woman would not be comforted, and at length the
magistrate lost his temper and bade her begone. Of
this, however, she took no notice; and then the magistrate,
in compassion for her great age and unwilling to
resort to extremities, promised her that he would have
the tiger arrested. Even then she would not go until the
warrant had been actually issued; so the magistrate, at
a loss what to do, asked his attendants which of them
would undertake the job.<a id="Anchor-189" title="Go to Footnote 189" href="#Footnote-189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Upon this one of them,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-220"><a id="Page_i-220"></a></span>
Li Nêng, who happened to be gloriously drunk, stepped
forward and said that he would; whereupon the warrant
was immediately issued and the old woman went away.
When our friend, Li Nêng, got sober, he was sorry for
what he had done; but reflecting that the whole thing
was a mere trick of his master’s to get rid of the old
woman’s importunities, did not trouble himself much
about it, handing in the warrant as if the arrest had
been made. “Not so,” cried the magistrate, “you said
you could do this, and now I shall not let you off.”
Li Nêng was at his wits’ end, and begged that he
might be allowed to impress the hunters of the district.<a id="Anchor-190" title="Go to Footnote 190" href="#Footnote-190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
<span class="pagenum" title="i-221"><a id="Page_i-221"></a></span>
This was conceded; so collecting together these men,
he proceeded to spend day and night among the hills
in the hope of catching a tiger, and thus making a show
of having fulfilled his duty.</p>

<p>A month passed away, during which he received
several hundred blows with the bamboo,<a id="Anchor-191" title="Go to Footnote 191" href="#Footnote-191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> and at length,
in despair, he betook himself to the Ch‘êng-huang
temple in the eastern suburb, where, falling on his
knees, he prayed and wept by turns. By-and-by a
tiger walked in, and Li Nêng, in a great fright, thought
he was going to be eaten alive. But the tiger took no
notice of anything, remaining seated in the doorway.
Li Nêng then addressed the animal as follows:&mdash;“O
tiger, if thou didst slay that old woman’s son, suffer
me to bind thee with this cord;” and, drawing a
rope from his pocket, threw it over the animal’s neck.
The tiger drooped its ears, and allowing itself to be
<span class="pagenum" title="i-222"><a id="Page_i-222"></a></span>
bound, followed Li Nêng to the magistrate’s office.
The latter then asked it, saying, “Did you eat the old
woman’s son?” to which the tiger replied by nodding
its head; whereupon the magistrate rejoined, “That
murderers should suffer death has ever been the law.<a id="Anchor-192" title="Go to Footnote 192" href="#Footnote-192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
Besides, this old woman had but one son, and by
killing him you took from her the sole support of her
declining years. But if now you will be as a son to
her, your crime shall be pardoned.” The tiger again
nodded assent, and accordingly the magistrate gave
orders that he should be released, at which the old
woman was highly incensed, thinking that the tiger
ought to have paid with its life for the destruction of
her son.</p>

<p>Next morning, however, when she opened the door
of her cottage, there lay a dead deer before it; and
the old woman, by selling the flesh and skin, was able
to purchase food. From that day this became a
common event, and sometimes the tiger would even
bring her money and valuables, so that she became
quite rich, and was much better cared for than she had
been even by her own son. Consequently, she became
very well-disposed to the tiger, which often came and
slept in the verandah, remaining for a whole day at a
time, and giving no cause of fear either to man or
beast. In a few years the old woman died, upon
<span class="pagenum" title="i-223"><a id="Page_i-223"></a></span>
which the tiger walked in and roared its lamentations
in the hall. However, with all the money she had
saved, she was able to have a splendid funeral; and
while her relatives were standing round the grave, out
rushed a tiger, and sent them all running away in fear.
But the tiger merely went up to the mound, and, after
roaring like a thunder-peal, disappeared again. Then
the people of that place built a shrine in honour of the
Faithful Tiger, and it remains there to this day.</p>

A DWARF.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">In</span> the reign of K‘ang Hsi, there was a magician who
carried about with him a wooden box, in which he had
a dwarf not much more than a foot in height. When
people gave him money he would open the box and bid
the little creature come out. The dwarf would then
sing a song and go in again. Arriving one day at Yeh,
the magistrate there seized the box, and taking it into
his yamên asked the dwarf whence he came. At first
he dared not reply, but on being pressed told the
magistrate everything. He said he belonged to a
respectable family, and that once when returning home
from school he was stupified by the magician, who gave
him some drug which made his limbs shrink, and then
took him about to exhibit to people. The magistrate
was very angry and had the magician beheaded, himself
taking charge of the dwarf. He was subsequently very
anxious to get him cured, but unable to obtain the proper
prescription.<a id="Anchor-193" title="Go to Footnote 193" href="#Footnote-193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<br/>
HSIANG-JU’S MISFORTUNES.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Kuang-p‘ing there lived an old man named Fêng,
who had an only son called Hsiang-ju. Both of them
were graduates; and the father was very particular and
strict, though the family had long been poor. Mrs.
Fêng and Hsiang-ju’s wife had died one shortly after the
other, so that the father and son were obliged to do their
household work for themselves.</p>

<p>One night Hsiang-ju was sitting out in the moonlight,
when suddenly a young lady from next door got on the
wall to have a look at him. He saw she was very pretty,
and as he approached her she began to laugh. He then
beckoned to her with his hand; but she did not move
either to come or to go away. At length, however, she
accepted the invitation, and descended the ladder that he
had placed for her. In reply to Hsiang-ju’s inquiries,
the young lady said her name was Hung-yü, and that
she lived next door; so Hsiang-ju, who was much taken
with her beauty, begged her to come over frequently and
have a chat. To this she readily assented, and continued
to do so for several months, until one evening
old Mr. Fêng, hearing sounds of talking and laughing in
<span class="pagenum" title="i-226"><a id="Page_i-226"></a></span>
his son’s room, got up and looked in. Seeing Miss
Hung-yü, he was exceedingly angry, and called his son
out, saying, “You good-for-nothing fellow! poor as we
are, why aren’t you at your books, instead of wasting
your time like this? A pretty thing for the neighbours
to hear of!&mdash;and even if they don’t hear of it, somebody
else will, and shorten your life accordingly.”<a id="Anchor-194" title="Go to Footnote 194" href="#Footnote-194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
Hsiang-ju fell on his knees, and with tears implored
forgiveness; whereupon his father turned to the young
lady, and said, “A girl who behaves like this disgraces
others as well as herself; and if people find this out, we
shan’t be the only ones to suffer.” The old man then
went back to bed in a rage, and Miss Hung-yü, weeping
bitterly, said to Hsiang-ju, “Your father’s reproaches
have overwhelmed me with shame. Our friendship is
now at an end.” “I could say nothing,” replied he,
“as long as my father was here; but if you have any
consideration for me, I pray you think nothing of his
remarks.” Miss Hung-yü protested, however, that they
could meet no more, and then Hsiang-ju also burst into
tears. “Do not weep,” cried she, “our friendship was
an impossible one, and time must sooner or later have
put an end to these visits. Meanwhile, I hear there is a
very good match to be made in the neighbourhood.”
Hsiang-ju replied that he was poor; but Miss Hung-yü
told him to meet her again the following evening, when
<span class="pagenum" title="i-227"><a id="Page_i-227"></a></span>
she would endeavour to do something for him. At the
appointed time she arrived, and, producing forty ounces
of silver, presented them to Hsiang-ju; telling him that
at a village some distance off there was a Miss Wei,
eighteen years of age, who was not yet married because
of the exorbitant demands of her parents, but that a
little extra outlay would secure for him the young lady’s
hand. Miss Hung-yü then bade him farewell, and
Hsiang-ju went off to inform his father, expressing a
desire to go and make inquiries, but saying nothing
about the forty ounces. His father, thinking that they
were not sufficiently well off, urged him not to go; however,
by dint of argument, he finally persuaded the old
man that, at any rate, there was no harm in trying. So
he borrowed horses and attendants, and set off to the
house of Mr. Wei, who was a man of considerable property;
and when he got there he asked Mr. Wei to
come outside and accord him a few minutes’ conversation.
Now the latter knew that Hsiang-ju belonged to
a very good family; and when he saw all the retinue that
Hsiang-ju had brought with him, he inwardly consented
to the match, though he was afraid that perhaps his
would-be son-in-law might not be as liberal as he would
like. Hsiang-ju soon perceived what Mr. Wei’s feelings
were, and emptied his purse on the table, at which Mr.
Wei was delighted, and begged a neighbour to allow the
marriage contract to be drawn up in his house.<a id="Anchor-195" title="Go to Footnote 195" href="#Footnote-195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Hsiang-ju
<span class="pagenum" title="i-228"><a id="Page_i-228"></a></span>
then went in to pay his respects to Mrs. Wei, whom
he found in a small, miserable room, with Miss Wei
hiding behind her. Still he was pleased to see that, in
spite of her homely toilette, the young lady herself was
very nice-looking; and, while he was being entertained
in the neighbour’s house, the old lady said, “It will not
be necessary for you, Sir, to come and fetch our daughter.
As soon as we have made up a small trousseau for
her, we will send her along to you.”<a id="Anchor-196" title="Go to Footnote 196" href="#Footnote-196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Hsiang-ju then
agreed with them upon a day for the wedding, and went
home and informed his father, pretending that the Wei
family only asked for respectability, and did not care
about money. His father was overjoyed to hear this;
and when the day came, the young lady herself arrived.
She proved to be a thrifty housekeeper and an obedient
wife, so that she and her husband got along capitally
together. In two years she had a son, who was called
Fu-êrh. And once, on the occasion of the great spring
festival, she was on her way to the family tombs, with
her boy in her arms, when she chanced to meet a man
named Sung, who was one of the gentry of the neighbourhood.
<span class="pagenum" title="i-229"><a id="Page_i-229"></a></span>
This Mr. Sung had been a Censor,<a id="Anchor-197" title="Go to Footnote 197" href="#Footnote-197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> but had
purchased his retirement, and was now leading a private
life, characterised by many overbearing and violent acts.
He was returning from his visit to the graves of his
ancestors when he saw Hsiang-ju’s wife, and, attracted
by her beauty, found out who she was; and imagining
that, as her husband was a poor scholar, he might easily
be induced for a consideration to part with the lady,
sent one of his servants to find out how the land lay.
When Hsiang-ju heard what was wanted, he was very
angry; but, reflecting on the power of his adversary,
controlled his passion, and passed the thing off with a
laugh. His father, however, to whom he repeated what
had occurred, got into a violent rage, and, rushing out,
flung his arms about, and called Mr. Sung every name
he could lay his tongue to. Mr. Sung’s emissary slunk
off and went home; and then a number of men were
sent by the enraged Sung, and these burst into the
house and gave old Fêng and his son a most tremendous
beating. In the middle of the hubbub Hsiang-ju’s wife
ran in, and, throwing her child down on the bed, tore
her hair and shrieked for help. Sung’s attendants immediately
<span class="pagenum" title="i-230"><a id="Page_i-230"></a></span>
surrounded her and carried her off, while
there lay her husband and his father, wounded on the
ground and the baby squalling on the bed. The neighbours,
pitying their wretched condition, helped them up
on to the couches, and by the next day Hsiang-ju could
walk with a stick; however, his father’s anger was not to
be appeased, and, after spitting a quantity of blood, he
died. Hsiang-ju wept bitterly at this, and, taking his
child in his arms, used every means to bring the
offenders to justice, but without the slightest success.
He then heard that his wife had put an end to her own
existence, and with this his cup of misery was full.
Unable to get his wrongs redressed, he often meditated
assassinating Sung in the open street,<a id="Anchor-198" title="Go to Footnote 198" href="#Footnote-198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> but was deterred
<span class="pagenum" title="i-231"><a id="Page_i-231"></a></span>
from attempting this by the number of his retainers and
the fear of leaving his son with no one to protect him. Day
and night he mourned over his lot, and his eyelids were
never closed in sleep, when suddenly in walked a personage
of striking appearance to condole with him on his
losses. The stranger’s face was covered with a huge
curly beard; and Hsiang-ju, not knowing who he was,
begged him to take a seat, and was about to ask whence
he came, when all at once he began, “Sir! have you
forgotten your father’s death, your wife’s disgrace?”
Thereupon Hsiang-ju, suspecting him to be a spy from
the Sung family, made some evasive reply, which so
irritated the stranger that he roared out, “I thought you
were a man; but now I know that you are a worthless,
contemptible wretch.” Hsiang-ju fell on his knees and
implored the stranger to forgive him, saying, “I was
afraid it was a trick of Sung’s: I will speak frankly to
you. For days I have lain, as it were, upon thorns, my
mouth filled with gall, restrained only by pity for this
little one and fear of breaking our ancestral line. Generous
friend, will you take care of my child if I fall?”
“That,” replied the stranger, “is the business of
women; I cannot undertake it. But what you wish
others to do for you, do yourself; and that which you
would do yourself, I will do for you.” When Hsiang-ju
<span class="pagenum" title="i-232"><a id="Page_i-232"></a></span>
heard these words he knocked his head upon the
ground; but the stranger took no more notice of him,
and walked out. Following him to the door, Hsiang-ju
asked his name, to which he replied, “If I cannot help
you I shall not wish to have your reproaches; if I do
help you, I shall not wish to have your gratitude.” The
stranger then disappeared, and Hsiang-ju, having a presentiment
that some misfortune was about to happen,
fled away with his child.</p>

<p>When night came, and the members of the Sung
family were wrapped in sleep, some one found his way
into their house and slew the ex-Censor and his two sons,
besides a maid-servant and one of the ladies. Information
was at once given to the authorities; and as the
Sung family had no doubt that the murderer was Hsiang-ju,
the magistrate, who was greatly alarmed,<a id="Anchor-199" title="Go to Footnote 199" href="#Footnote-199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> sent out
lictors to arrest him. Hsiang-ju, however, was nowhere
to be found, a fact which tended to confirm the suspicions
of the Sung family; and they, too, despatched a
number of servants to aid the mandarin in effecting his
capture. Towards evening the lictors and others reached
a hill, and, hearing a child cry, made for the sound, and
thus secured the object of their search, whom they
bound and led away. As the child went on crying
louder than ever, they took it from him and threw it
<span class="pagenum" title="i-233"><a id="Page_i-233"></a></span>
down by the wayside, thereby nearly causing Hsiang-ju
to die of grief and rage. On being brought before the
magistrate he was asked why he had killed these people;
to which he replied that he was falsely accused, “For,”
said he, “they died in the night, whereas I had gone
away in the daytime. Besides,” added he, “how, with a
crying baby in my arms, could I scale walls and kill
people?” “If you didn’t kill people,” cried the magistrate,
“why did you run away?” Hsiang had no
answer to make to this, and he was accordingly ordered
to prison; whereupon he wept and said, “I can die
without regret; but what has my child done that he, too,
should be punished?” “You,” replied the magistrate,
“have slain the children of others; how can you complain
if your child meets the same fate?” Hsiang-ju
was then stripped of his degree<a id="Anchor-200" title="Go to Footnote 200" href="#Footnote-200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> and subjected to all
kinds of indignities, but they were unable to wring a
confession from his lips;<a id="Anchor-201" title="Go to Footnote 201" href="#Footnote-201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> and that very night, as the
magistrate lay down, he heard a sharp noise of something
striking the bed, and, jumping up in a fright,
found, by the light of a candle, a small, keen blade
sticking in the wood at the head of his couch so tightly
that it could not be drawn out. Terribly alarmed at
this, the magistrate walked round the room with a spear
over his shoulder, but without finding anything; and
then, reflecting that nothing more was to be feared from
Sung, who was dead, as well as his two sons, he laid
<span class="pagenum" title="i-234"><a id="Page_i-234"></a></span>
Hsiang-ju’s case before the higher authorities, and obtained
for him an acquittal. Hsiang-ju was released and
went home. His cupboard, however, was empty, and
there was nothing except his own shadow within the four
walls of his house. Happily, his neighbours took pity
on him and supplied him with food; and whenever he
thought upon the vengeance that had been wreaked, his
countenance assumed an expression of joy; but as often
as his misfortunes and the extinction of his family came
into his mind, his tears would begin to flow. And when
he remembered the poverty of his life and the end of
his ancestral line, he would seek out some solitary spot,
and there burst into an ungovernable fit of grief. Thus
things went on for about six months, when the search
after the murderer began to be relaxed; and then
Hsiang-ju petitioned for the recovery of his wife’s bones,
which he took home with him and buried. His sorrows
made him wish to die, and he lay tossing about on the
bed without any object in life, when suddenly he heard
somebody knock at the door. Keeping quiet to listen,
he distinguished the sound of a voice outside talking
with a child; and, getting up to look, he perceived a
young lady, who said to him, “Your great wrongs are all
redressed, and now, luckily, you have nothing to ail
you.” The voice seemed familiar to him, but he could
not at the moment recall where he had heard it; so he
lighted a candle, and Miss Hung-yü stood before him.
She was leading a small, happy-looking child by the
hand; and after she and Hsiang-ju had expressed their
mutual satisfaction at meeting once more, Miss Hung-yü
<span class="pagenum" title="i-235"><a id="Page_i-235"></a></span>
pushed the boy forward, saying, “Have you forgotten
your father?” The boy clung to her dress, and looked
shyly at Hsiang-ju, who, on examining him closely,
found that he was Fu-êrh. “Where did he come
from?” asked his father, in astonishment, not unmingled
with tears. “I will tell you all,” replied Miss
Hung-yü. “I was only deceiving you when I said I
belonged to a neighbouring family. I am really a fox,
and, happening to go out one evening, I heard a child
crying in a ditch. I took him home and brought him
up; and, now that your troubles are over, I return him
to you, that father and son may be together.” Hsiang-ju
wiped away his tears and thanked her heartily; but
Fu-êrh kept close to Miss Hung-yü, whom he had come
to regard as a mother, and did not seem to recognise his
father again. Before day-break Miss Hung-yü said she
must go away; but Hsiang-ju fell upon his knees and
entreated her to stop, until at last she said she was
only joking, adding that, in a new establishment like
theirs, it would be a case of early to rise and late to bed.
She then set to work cutting fuel and sweeping it up,
toiling hard as if she had been a man, which made
Hsiang-ju regret that he was too poor to have all this
done for her. However, she bade him mind his books,
and not trouble himself about the state of their affairs,
as they were not likely to die of hunger. She also
produced some money, and bought implements for
spinning, besides renting a few acres of land and
hiring labourers to till them. Day by day she would
shoulder her hoe and work in the fields, or employ
<span class="pagenum" title="i-236"><a id="Page_i-236"></a></span>
herself in mending the roof, so that her fame as
a good wife spread abroad, and the neighbours were
more than ever pleased to help them. In half-a-year’s
time their home was like that of a well-to-do family,
with plenty of servants about; but one day Hsiang-ju
said to Miss Hung-yü, “With all that you have accomplished
on my behalf, there is still one thing left
undone.” On her asking him what it was, he continued:
“The examination for master’s degree is at hand, and I
have not yet recovered the bachelor’s degree of which I
was stripped.” “Ah,” replied she, “some time back I
had your name replaced upon the list; had I waited for
you to tell me, it would have been too late.” Hsiang-ju
marvelled very much at this, and accordingly took his
master’s degree. He was then thirty-six years of age,
the master of broad lands and fine houses; and Miss
Hung-yü, who looked delicate enough to be blown away
by the wind, and yet worked harder than an ordinary
labourer’s wife, keeping her hands smooth and nice in
spite of winter weather, gave herself out to be thirty-eight,
though no one took her to be much more than
twenty.</p>

CHANG’S TRANSFORMATION.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Chang Yü-tan</span>, of Chao-yuan, was a wild fellow, who
pursued his studies at the Hsiao temple. Now it
chanced that the magistrate of the district, Mr. Tsêng
of San-han, had a daughter who was very fond of
hunting, and that one day young Chang met her in
the fields, and was much struck with her great beauty.
She was dressed in an embroidered sable jacket, and
rode about on a small palfrey, for all the world like a
girl in a picture. Chang went home with the young
lady still in his thoughts, his heart being deeply touched;
but he soon after heard, to his infinite sorrow and dismay,
that Miss Tsêng had died suddenly. Their own
home being at a distance,<a id="Anchor-202" title="Go to Footnote 202" href="#Footnote-202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> her father deposited the
coffin in a temple;<a id="Anchor-203" title="Go to Footnote 203" href="#Footnote-203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> the very temple, in fact, where her
lover was residing. Accordingly Chang paid to her
remains the same respect he would have offered to a
<span class="pagenum" title="i-238"><a id="Page_i-238"></a></span>
god; he burnt incense every morning, and poured out
libations at every meal, always accompanied by the
following invocation:&mdash;“I had hardly seen you when
your spirit became ever present to me in my dreams.
But you passed suddenly away; and now, near as we
are together, we are as far apart as if separated by hills
and rivers. Alas! alas! In life you were under the
control of your parents; now, however, there is nothing
to restrain you, and with your supernatural power, I
should be hearing the rustle of your robe as you
approach to ease the sorrow of my heart.” Day and
night he prayed thus, and when some six months had
passed away, and he was one night trimming his lamp
to read, he raised his head and saw a young lady
standing, all smiles, before him. Rising up, he inquired
who she was; to which his visitor replied, “Grateful to
you for your love of me, I was unable to resist the
temptation of coming to thank you myself.” Chang
then offered her a seat, and they sat together chatting
for some time. From this date the young lady used
to come in every evening, and on one occasion said
to Chang, “I was formerly very fond of riding and
archery, shooting the musk and slaying the deer; it is
a great sorrow to me to be deprived of these pleasures
by death. If you have any friendly feelings towards me,
I pray you recite for me the Diamond <i>sutra</i><a id="Anchor-204" title="Go to Footnote 204" href="#Footnote-204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> five
<span class="pagenum" title="i-239"><a id="Page_i-239"></a></span>
thousand and forty-eight times, and I will never forget
your kindness.” Chang did as he was asked, getting
up every night and telling his beads before the coffin,
until the occasion of a certain festival, when he wished
to go home to his parents, and take the young lady
with him. Miss Tsêng said she was afraid her feet
were too tender to walk far; but Chang offered to
carry her, to which she laughingly assented. It was
just like carrying a child, she was so light;<a id="Anchor-205" title="Go to Footnote 205" href="#Footnote-205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> and by
degrees Chang got so accustomed to taking her about
with him, that when he went up for his examination
she went in too.<a id="Anchor-206" title="Go to Footnote 206" href="#Footnote-206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The only thing was she could not
travel except at night. Later on, Chang would have
gone up for his master’s degree, but the young lady
told him it was of no use to try, for it was not
destined that he should pass; and accordingly he desisted
from his intention. Four or five years afterwards,
Miss Tsêng’s father resigned his appointment,
and so poor was he that he could not afford to pay
for the removal of his daughter’s coffin, but wanted to
bury it economically where it was. Unfortunately, he
had no ground of his own, and then Chang came
forward and said that a friend of his had a piece of
waste land near the temple, and that he might bury it
<span class="pagenum" title="i-240"><a id="Page_i-240"></a></span>
there. Mr. Tsêng was very glad to accept, and Chang
kindly assisted him with the funeral,&mdash;for what reason
the former was quite unable to guess. One night after
this, as Miss Tsêng was sitting by Chang’s side, her
father having already returned home, she burst into a
flood of tears, and said, “For five years we have been
good friends; we must now part. I can never repay
your goodness to me.” Chang was alarmed, and asked
her what she meant; to which she replied, “Your
sympathy has told for me in the realms below. The
sum of my <i>sutras</i> is complete, and to-day I am to be
born again in the family of a high official, Mr. Lu, of
Ho-pei. If you do not forget the present time, meet
me there in fifteen years from now, on the 16th of
the 8th moon.” “Alas!” cried Chang, “I am already
over thirty, and in fifteen years more I shall be drawing
near the wood.<a id="Anchor-207" title="Go to Footnote 207" href="#Footnote-207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> What good will our meeting do?”
“I can be your servant,” replied Miss Tsêng, “and so
make some return to you. But come, escort me a
few miles on my way; the road is beset with brambles,
and I shall have some trouble with my dress.” So
Chang carried her as before, until they reached a high
road, where they found a number of carriages and
horses, the latter with one or two riders on the backs
of each, and three or four, or even more persons, in
every carriage. But there was one richly-decorated
<span class="pagenum" title="i-241"><a id="Page_i-241"></a></span>
carriage, with embroidered curtains and red awnings,
in which sat only one old woman, who, when she saw
Miss Tsêng, called out, “Ah, there you are.” “Here
I am,” replied Miss Tsêng; and then she turned to
Chang and said, “We must part here; do not forget
what I told you.” Chang promised he would remember;
and then the old woman helped her up into the carriage,
round went the wheels, off went the attendants,
and they were gone. Sorrowfully Chang wended his
way home, and there wrote upon the wall the date
mentioned by Miss Tsêng; after which, bethinking himself
of the efficacy of prayer, he took to reciting <i>sutras</i>
more energetically than ever. By-and-by he dreamed
that an angel appeared to him, and said, “The bent
of your mind is excellent indeed, but you must visit
the Southern Sea.”<a id="Anchor-208" title="Go to Footnote 208" href="#Footnote-208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Asking how far off the Southern
Sea was, the angel informed him it was close by; and
then waking up, and understanding what was required
of him, he fixed his sole thoughts on Buddha, and
lived a purer life than before. In three years’ time his
two sons, Ming and Chêng, came out very high on the
list at the examination for the second degree, in spite
of which worldly successes Chang continued to lead his
usual holy life. Then one night he dreamed that
another angel led him among beautiful halls and
palaces, where he saw a personage sitting down who
<span class="pagenum" title="i-242"><a id="Page_i-242"></a></span>
resembled Buddha himself. This personage said to
him, “My son, your virtue is a matter of great joy;
unhappily your term of life is short, and I have, therefore,
made an appeal to God<a id="Anchor-209" title="Go to Footnote 209" href="#Footnote-209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> on your behalf.” Chang
prostrated himself, and knocked his head upon the
ground; upon which he was commanded to rise, and
was served with tea, fragrant as the epidendrum. A boy
was next instructed to take him to bathe in a pool, the
water of which was so exquisitely clear that he could
count the fishes swimming about therein. He found
it warm as he walked in, and scented like the leaves
of the lotus-flower; and gradually the water got deeper
and deeper, until he went down altogether and passed
through with his head under water. He then waked
up in a fright; but from this moment he became
more robust and his sight improved. As he stroked
his beard the white hairs all came out, and by-and-by the
black ones too; the wrinkles on his face were smoothed
away, and in a few months he had the beardless face
of a boy of fifteen or sixteen. He also grew very
fond of playing about like other boys, and would sometimes
tumble head over heels, and be picked up by
his sons. Soon afterwards his wife died of old age,
and his sons begged him to marry again into some
good family; but he said he should be obliged to go to
Ho-pei first; and then, calculating his dates, found that
<span class="pagenum" title="i-243"><a id="Page_i-243"></a></span>
the appointed time had arrived. So he ordered his
horses and servants, and set off for Ho-pei, where he
discovered that there actually was a high official named
Lu. Now Mr. Lu had a daughter, who when born was
able to talk,<a id="Anchor-210" title="Go to Footnote 210" href="#Footnote-210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and became very clever and beautiful as
she grew up. She was the idol of her parents, and
had been asked in marriage by many suitors, but would
not accept any of them; and when her father and
mother inquired her motives for refusal, she told them
the story of her engagement in her former life.
“Silly child,” said they, reckoning up the time, and
laughing at her; “that Mr. Chang would now be
about fifty years of age, a changed and feeble old
man. Even if he is still alive, his hair will be white
and his teeth gone.” But their daughter would not
listen to them; and, finding her so obstinate in her
determination, they instructed the doorkeeper to admit
no strangers until the appointed time should have
passed, that thus her expectations might be brought to
naught. Before long, Chang arrived, but the doorkeeper
would not let him in, and he went back to his
inn in great distress, not knowing what to do. He
then took to walking about the fields, and secretly
making inquiries concerning the family. Meanwhile
Miss Tsêng thought that he had broken his engagement,
and refused all food, giving herself up to tears
alone. Her mother argued that he was probably dead,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-244"><a id="Page_i-244"></a></span>
or in any case that the breach of engagement was no
fault of her daughter’s; to none of which, however,
would Miss Tsêng listen, lying where she was the livelong
day. Mr. Lu now became anxious about her, and
determined to see what manner of man this Chang
might be; so, on the plea of taking a walk, he went
out to meet him in the fields, and to his astonishment
found quite a young man. They sat down together
on some leaves, and after chatting awhile Mr. Lu was
so charmed with his young friend’s bearing that he invited
him to his house. No sooner had they arrived,
than Mr. Lu begged Chang to excuse him a moment,
and ran in first to tell his daughter, who exerted herself
to get up and take a peep at the stranger. Finding,
however, that he was not the Chang she had formerly
known, she burst into tears and crept back to bed,
upbraiding her parents for trying to deceive her thus.
Her father declared he was no other than Chang, but
his daughter replied only with tears; and then he went
back very much upset to his guest, whom he treated
with great want of courtesy. Chang asked him if he was
not the Mr. Lu, of such and such a position, to which
he replied in a vacant kind of way that he was, looking
the other way all the time and paying no attention to
Chang. The latter did not approve of this behaviour,
and accordingly took his leave; and in a few days
Miss Tsêng had cried herself to death. Chang then
dreamed that she appeared to him, and said, “Was it
you after all that I saw? You were so changed in age
and appearance that when I looked upon your face I
<span class="pagenum" title="i-245"><a id="Page_i-245"></a></span>
did not know you. I have already died from grief; but
if you make haste to the little street shrine and summon
my spirit back, I may still recover. Be not late!”
Chang then waked, and immediately made inquiries at
Mr. Lu’s house, when he found that the young lady
had been dead two days. Telling her father his dream,
they went forth to summon the spirit back; and on
opening the shroud, and throwing themselves with
lamentations over the corpse, a noise was heard in the
young lady’s throat, and her cherry lips parted. They
moved her on to a bed, and soon she began to moan,
to the great joy of Mr. Lu, who took Chang out of
the room and, over a bumper of wine, asked some
questions about his family. He was glad to find that
Chang was a suitable match for his daughter, and an
auspicious day was fixed for the wedding. In a fortnight
the event came off, the bride being escorted to
Chang’s house by her father, who remained with them
six months before going home again. They were a
youthful pair, and people who didn’t know the story
mistook Chang’s son and daughter-in-law for his father
and mother. A year later Mr. Lu died; and his son,
a mere child, having been badly wounded by some
scoundrels, and the family property being almost gone,
Chang made him come and live with them, and be
one of their own family.</p>

<br/>
A TAOIST PRIEST.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Once</span> upon a time there was a Mr. Han, who
belonged to a wealthy family, and was fond of entertaining
people. A man named Hsü, of the same town,
frequently joined him over the bottle; and on one
occasion when they were together a Taoist priest came
to the door with his alms-bowl<a id="Anchor-211" title="Go to Footnote 211" href="#Footnote-211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> in his hand. The
servants threw him some money and food, but the
priest would not accept them, neither would he go
away; and at length they would take no more notice
of him. Mr. Han heard the noise of the priest
knocking his bowl<a id="Anchor-212" title="Go to Footnote 212" href="#Footnote-212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> going on for a long time, and
asked his servants what was the matter; and they had
hardly told him when the priest himself walked in.
<span class="pagenum" title="i-247"><a id="Page_i-247"></a></span>
Mr. Han begged him to be seated; whereupon the
priest bowed to both gentlemen and took his seat.
On making the usual inquiries, they found that he
lived at an old tumble-down temple to the east of the
town, and Mr. Han expressed regret at not having
heard sooner of his arrival, so that he might have
shown him the proper hospitality of a resident. The
priest said that he had only recently arrived, and had
no friends in the place; but hearing that Mr. Han was
a jovial fellow, he had been very anxious to take a
glass with him. Mr. Han then ordered wine, and the
priest soon distinguished himself as a hard drinker;
Mr. Hsü treating him all the time with a certain
amount of disrespect in consequence of his shabby
appearance, while Mr. Han made allowances for him
as being a traveller. When he had drunk over twenty
large cups of wine, the priest took his leave, returning
subsequently whenever any jollification was going on,
no matter whether it was eating or drinking. Even
Han began now to tire a little of him; and on one
occasion Hsü said to him in raillery, “Good priest,
you seem to like being a guest; why don’t you play the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-248"><a id="Page_i-248"></a></span>
host sometimes for a change?” “Ah,” replied the
priest, “I am much the same as yourself&mdash;a mouth carried
between a couple of shoulders.”<a id="Anchor-213" title="Go to Footnote 213" href="#Footnote-213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> This put Hsü to
shame, and he had no answer to make; so the priest
continued, “But although that is so, I have been
revolving the question with myself for some time, and
when we do meet I shall do my best to repay your
kindness with a cup of my own poor wine.” When
they had finished drinking, the priest said he hoped he
should have the pleasure of their company the following
day at noon; and at the appointed time the two friends
went together, not expecting, however, to find anything
ready for them. But the priest was waiting for them in
the street; and passing through a handsome court-yard,
they beheld long suites of elegant apartments stretching
away before them. In great astonishment, they
remarked to the priest that they had not visited this
temple for some time, and asked when it had been
thus repaired; to which he replied that the work had
been only lately completed. They then went inside,
and there was a magnificently-decorated apartment, such
as would not be found even in the houses of the
wealthy. This made them begin to feel more respect
for their host; and no sooner had they sat down than
wine and food were served by a number of boys, all
about sixteen years of age, and dressed in embroidered
coats, with red shoes. The wine and the eatables
<span class="pagenum" title="i-249"><a id="Page_i-249"></a></span>
were delicious, and very nicely served; and when the
dinner was taken away, a course of rare fruits was put
on the table, the names of all of which it would be
impossible to mention. They were arranged in dishes
of crystal and jade, the brilliancy of which lighted up
the surrounding furniture; and the goblets in which the
wine was poured were of glass,<a id="Anchor-214" title="Go to Footnote 214" href="#Footnote-214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> and more than a foot
in circumference. The priest here cried out, “Call the
Shih sisters,” whereupon one of the boys went out, and
in a few moments two elegant young ladies walked in.
The first was tall and slim like a willow wand; the
other was short and very young, both being exceedingly
pretty girls. Being told to sing while the company
were drinking, the younger beat time and sang a song,
while the elder accompanied her on the flageolet.
They acquitted themselves admirably; and, when the
song was over, the priest holding his goblet bottom
upwards in the air, challenged his guests to follow his
example, bidding his servants pour out more wine all
round. He then turned to the girls, and remarked
that they had not danced for a long time, asking if
they were still able to do so; upon which a carpet was
spread by one of the boys, and the two young ladies
proceeded to dance, their long robes waving about and perfuming
the air around. The dance concluded, they leant
against a painted screen, while the two guests gradually
<span class="pagenum" title="i-250"><a id="Page_i-250"></a></span>
became more and more confused, and were at last irrecoverably
drunk. The priest took no notice of them;
but when he had finished drinking, he got up and said,
“Pray, go on with your wine; I am going to rest
awhile, and will return by-and-by.” He then went
away, and lay down on a splendid couch at the other
end of the room; at which Hsü was very angry, and
shouted out, “Priest, you are a rude fellow,” at the
same time making towards him with a view of rousing
him up. The priest then ran out, and Han and Hsü
lay down to sleep, one at each end of the room, on
elaborately-carved couches covered with beautiful mattresses.
When they woke up, they found themselves
lying in the road, Mr. Hsü with his head in a dirty
drain. Hard by were a couple of rush huts; but
everything else was gone.</p>

<br/>
THE FIGHT WITH THE FOXES.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">In</span> the province of Chih-li, there was a wealthy family
in want of a tutor. One day a graduate presented
himself at the door, and was asked by the master of
the house to walk in; and he conversed so pleasantly
that in a short time it was clear to both sides that
they were mutually pleased with each other. The tutor
said his name was Hu; and when the usual present
had been made to him, he was forthwith provided with
apartments, and entered very energetically upon his
duties, proving himself a scholar of no mean order.
He was, however, very fond of roaming, and generally
came back in the middle of the night, not troubling
himself to knock if the door was locked but suddenly
appearing on the inside. It was therefore suspected
that he was a fox, though as his intentions seemed
to be harmless, he was treated extremely well, and not
with any want of courtesy as if he had been something
uncanny. By-and-by he discovered that his master
<span class="pagenum" title="i-252"><a id="Page_i-252"></a></span>
had a daughter,<a id="Anchor-215" title="Go to Footnote 215" href="#Footnote-215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> and being desirous of securing the match
was always dropping hints to that effect, which his master,
on the other hand, invariably pretended not to understand.
One day he went off for a holiday, and on the
next day a stranger called; who, tying a black mule at the
door, accepted the invitation of the master to take a seat
within. He was about fifty years of age, very neat and
clean in his dress, and gentlemanly in his manners.
When they were seated, the stranger began by saying
that he was come with proposals of marriage on behalf of
Mr. Hu; to which his host, after some consideration,
replied that he and Mr. Hu got along excellently well
as friends, and there was no object in bringing about
a closer connection. “Besides,” added he, “my
daughter is already betrothed, and I beg you, therefore,
to ask Mr. Hu to excuse me.” The stranger
said he was quite sure the young lady was not engaged,
and inquired what might be the objection to the match:
but it was all of no avail, until at length he remarked,
“Mr. Hu is of a good family; I see no reason why
you should have such an aversion to him.” “Well,
then,” replied the other, “I will tell you what it is. We
don’t like his <em>species</em>.” The stranger here got very angry,
and his host also lost his temper, so that they came to
high words, and were already on the way to blows, when
the latter bade his servants give the stranger a beating
<span class="pagenum" title="i-253"><a id="Page_i-253"></a></span>
and turn him out. The stranger then retired, leaving
his mule behind him; and when they drew near to
look at it they found a huge creature with black hair,
drooping ears, and a long tail. They tried to lead it
away, but it would not move; and on giving it a shove
with the hand from behind, it toppled over and was
discovered to be only of straw. In consequence of
the angry words that had been said, the master of
the house felt sure that there would be an attempt
at revenge, and accordingly made all preparations; and
sure enough the next day a whole host of fox-soldiers
arrived, some on horseback, some on foot, some with
spears, and others with cross-bows, men and horses
trampling along with an indescribable din. The family
were afraid to leave the house, and the foxes shouted
out to set the place on fire, at which the inmates were
dreadfully alarmed; but just then one of the bravest
of them rushed forth with a number of the servants
to engage the foxes. Stones and arrows flew about
in all directions, and many on both sides were wounded;
at length, however, the foxes drew off leaving their
swords on the field. These glittered like frost or
snow, but when picked up turned out to be only millet-stalks.
“Is this all their cunning?” cried their adversary,
laughing, at the same time making still more
careful preparations in case the foxes should come
again. Next day they were deliberating together, when
suddenly a giant descended upon them from the sky.
He was over ten feet in height by several feet in
breadth, and brandished a sword as broad as half a
<span class="pagenum" title="i-254"><a id="Page_i-254"></a></span>
door; but they attacked him so vigorously with arrows
and stones that he was soon stretched dead upon the
ground, when they saw that he was made of grass. Our
friends now began to make light of their fox-foes, and
as they saw nothing more of them for three days their
precautions were somewhat relaxed. The foxes, however,
soon reappeared, armed with bows and arrows,
and succeeded in shooting the master of the house
in the back, disappearing when he summoned his
servants and proceeded to attack them. Then, drawing
the arrow from his back, he found it was a long
thorn; and thus the foxes went on for a month or
so, coming and going, and making it necessary to
take precautions, though not really inflicting any serious
injury. This annoyed the master of the family very
much, until one day Mr. Hu<a id="Anchor-216" title="Go to Footnote 216" href="#Footnote-216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> himself appeared with
a troop of soldiers at his back, and he immediately
went out to meet him. Mr. Hu withdrew among his
men, but the master called to him to come forth, and
then asked him what he had done that soldiers
should be thus brought against his family. The foxes
were now on the point of discharging their arrows;
Mr. Hu, however, stopped them; whereupon he and
his old master shook hands, and the latter invited him
to walk into his old room. Wine being served, his
host observed, “You, Mr. Hu, are a man of intelligence,
and I trust you will make allowances for me. Friends
<span class="pagenum" title="i-255"><a id="Page_i-255"></a></span>
as we were, I should naturally have been glad to form a
connection with you; your carriages, however, horses,
houses, etc., are not those of ordinary mortals; and
even had my daughter consented, you must know the
thing would have been impossible, she being still a
great deal too young.” Mr. Hu was somewhat disconcerted
at this, but his host continued, “It’s of no
consequence; we can still be friends as before, and
if you do not despise us earthly creatures, there is
my son whom you have taught; he is fifteen years old,
and I should be proud to see him connected with you
if such an arrangement should be feasible.” Mr. Hu was
delighted, and said, “I have a daughter one year younger
than your son; she is neither ugly nor stupid. How
would she do?” His host got up and made a low
bow, which Mr. Hu forthwith returned, and they then
became the best of friends, forgetting all about the
former unpleasantness. Wine was given to Mr. Hu’s
attendants, and every one was made happy. The host
now inquired where Mr. Hu lived, that the ceremony
of pouring out a libation to the geese<a id="Anchor-217" title="Go to Footnote 217" href="#Footnote-217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> might be performed;
but Mr. Hu said this would not be necessary,
and remained drinking till night, when he went away
again. From this time there was no more trouble; and
a year passed without any news of Mr. Hu, so that
<span class="pagenum" title="i-256"><a id="Page_i-256"></a></span>
it seemed as if he wished to get out of his bargain.
The family, however, went on waiting, and in six months
more Mr. Hu reappeared, when, after a few general
remarks, he declared that his daughter was ready, and
requested that an auspicious day might be fixed for
her to come to her husband’s home. This being
arranged, the young lady arrived with a retinue of
sedan-chairs, and horses, and a beautiful trousseau that
nearly filled a room.<a id="Anchor-218" title="Go to Footnote 218" href="#Footnote-218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> She was unusually respectful
to her father and mother in-law, and the former was
much pleased with the match. Her father and a
younger brother of his had escorted her to the house,
and conversing away in a most refined style they sat
drinking till daybreak before they went away. The
bride herself had the gift of foreknowing whether the
harvest would be good or bad, and her advice was
always taken in such matters. Mr. Hu and his brother,
and also their mother, often came to visit her in her
new home, and were then very frequently seen by
people.</p>

<br/>
THE KING.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> Governor of Hu-nan despatched a
magistrate to the capital in charge of treasure to
the amount of six hundred thousand ounces of silver.
On the road the magistrate encountered a violent storm
of rain, which so delayed him that night came on before
he was able to reach the next station. He therefore took
refuge in an old temple; but, when morning came, he was
horrified to find that the treasure had disappeared.
Unable to fix the guilt on any one, he returned forthwith
to the Governor and told him the whole story.
The latter, however, refused to believe what the magistrate
said, and would have had him severely punished,
but that each and all of his attendants stoutly corroborated
his statements; and accordingly he bade him
return and endeavour to find the missing silver. When
the magistrate got back to the temple, he met an extraordinary-looking
blind man, who informed him that
he could read people’s thoughts, and further went on
to say that the magistrate had come there on a matter of
money. The latter replied that it was so, and recounted
the misfortune that had overtaken him; whereupon the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-258"><a id="Page_i-258"></a></span>
blind man called for sedan-chairs, and told the magistrate
to follow and see for himself, which he accordingly
did, accompanied by all his retinue. If the blind man
said east, they went east; or if north, north; journeying
along for five days until far among the hills, where they
beheld a large city with a great number of inhabitants.
They entered the gates and proceeded on for a short
distance, when suddenly the blind man cried, “Stop!”
and, alighting from his chair, pointed to a lofty door
facing the west, at which he told the magistrate to knock
and make what inquiries were necessary. He then
bowed and took his leave, and the magistrate obeyed
his instructions, whereupon a man came out in reply
to his summons. He was dressed in the fashion of the
Han dynasty,<a id="Anchor-219" title="Go to Footnote 219" href="#Footnote-219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and did not say what his name was; but
as soon as the magistrate informed him wherefore he had
come, he replied that if the latter would wait a few
days he himself would assist him in the matter. The
man then conducted the magistrate within, and giving
him a room to himself, provided him regularly with
food and drink. One day he chanced to stroll away to the
back of the building, and there found a beautiful garden
with dense avenues of pine-trees and smooth lawns of
fine grass. After wandering about for some time among
the arbours and ornamental buildings, the magistrate
came to a lofty kiosque, and mounted the steps, when
he saw hanging on the wall before him a number of
<span class="pagenum" title="i-259"><a id="Page_i-259"></a></span>
human skins, each with its eyes, nose, ears, mouth, and
heart.<a id="Anchor-220" title="Go to Footnote 220" href="#Footnote-220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Horrified at this, he beat a hasty retreat to his
quarters, convinced that he was about to leave his own
skin in this out-of-the-way place, and giving himself up for
lost. He reflected, however, that he should probably gain
nothing by trying to escape, and made up his mind to
wait; and on the following day the same man came to
fetch him, saying he could now have an audience. The
magistrate replied that he was ready; and his conductor
then mounted a fiery steed, leaving the other to follow on
foot. By-and-by they reached a door like that leading into
a Viceroy’s <i>yamên</i>, where stood on either side crowds
of official servants, preserving the utmost silence and
decorum. The man here dismounted and led the
magistrate inside; and after passing through another
door they came into the presence of a king, who wore
a cap decorated with pearls, and an embroidered sash,
and sat facing the south. The magistrate rushed forward
and prostrated himself on the ground; upon
which the king asked him if he was the Hu-nan official
who had been charged with the conveyance of treasure.
On his answering in the affirmative, the king said, “The
money is all here; it’s a mere trifle, but I have no
objection to receive it as a present from the Governor.”
The magistrate here burst into tears, and declared that
<span class="pagenum" title="i-260"><a id="Page_i-260"></a></span>
his term of grace had already expired: that he would be
punished if he went back thus, especially as he would
have no evidence to adduce in substantiation of his
story. “That is easy enough,” replied the king, and
put into his hands a thick letter, which he bade him
give to the Governor, assuring him that this would
prevent him from getting into any trouble. He also provided
him with an escort; and the magistrate, who
dared not argue the point further, sorrowfully accepted
the letter and took his departure. The road he travelled
along was not that by which he had come; and when
the hills ended, his escort left him and went back. In a
few days more he reached Ch‘ang-sha, and respectfully
informed the Governor of what had taken place; but
the Governor thought he was telling more lies, and in a
great rage bade the attendants bind him hand and foot.
The magistrate then drew the letter forth from his coat;
and when the Governor broke the seal and saw its
contents, his face turned deadly pale. He gave orders
for the magistrate to be unbound, remarking that the
loss of the treasure was of no importance, and that
the magistrate was free to go. Instructions were next
issued that the amount was to be made up in some way
or other and forwarded to the capital; and meanwhile
the Governor fell sick and died.</p>

<p>Now this Governor had had a wife of whom he was
dotingly fond; and one morning when they waked up,
lo! all her hair was gone. The whole establishment was
in dismay, no one knowing what to make of such an
occurrence. But the letter above-mentioned contained
<span class="pagenum" title="i-261"><a id="Page_i-261"></a></span>
that hair, accompanied by the following words:&mdash;“Ever
since you first entered into public life your career has
been one of peculation and avarice. The six hundred
thousand ounces of silver are safely stored in my
treasury. Make good this sum from your own accumulated
extortions. The officer you charged with
the treasure is innocent; he must not be wrongly
punished. On a former occasion I took your wife’s
hair as a gentle warning. If now you disobey my
injunctions, it will not be long before I have your head.
Herewith I return the hair as an evidence of what
I say.” When the Governor was dead, his family
divulged the contents of the letter; and some of his
subordinates sent men to search for the city, but
they only found range upon range of inaccessible
mountains, with nothing like a road or path.</p>

<br/>
ENGAGED TO A NUN.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> I-ling, in Hupei, there lived a young man named
Chên Yü, the son of a graduate. He was a good
scholar and a handsome fellow, and had made a reputation
for himself even before he arrived at manhood.
When quite a boy, a physiognomist had predicted that
he would marry a Taoist nun; but his parents regarded
it only as a joke, and made several attempts to get him
a different kind of wife. Their efforts, however, had
not hitherto proved successful, the difficulty being to
find a suitable match.</p>

<p>Now his maternal grandmother lived at Huang-kang;
and on one occasion, when young Chên was paying her
a visit, he heard some one say that of the four Yüns at
Huang-chou the youngest had no peer. This remark
referred to some very nice-looking nuns who lived in a
temple<a id="Anchor-221" title="Go to Footnote 221" href="#Footnote-221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> a few miles from his grandmother’s house; and
<span class="pagenum" title="i-263"><a id="Page_i-263"></a></span>
accordingly Chên secretly set off to see them, and,
knocking at the door, was very cordially received by the
four ladies, who were persons of considerable refinement.
The youngest was a girl of incomparable beauty, and
Chên could not keep his eyes off her, until at last she
put her hand up to her face and looked the other way.
Her companions now going out of the room to get tea
for their visitor, Chên availed himself of the opportunity
to ask the young lady’s name; to which she replied that
she was called Yün-ch‘i, and that her surname was
Ch‘ên. “How extraordinary!” cried Chên; “and
mine is P‘an.”<a id="Anchor-222" title="Go to Footnote 222" href="#Footnote-222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> This made her blush very much, and
she bent her head down and made no answer; by-and-by
rising up and going away. The tea then came in,
accompanied by some nice fruit, and the nuns began
telling him their names. One was Pai Yün-shên, and
thirty odd years of age; another was Shêng Yün-mien,
just twenty; and the third was Liang Yün-tung, twenty-four
or five years old, but the junior in point of religious
standing.<a id="Anchor-223" title="Go to Footnote 223" href="#Footnote-223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Yün-ch‘i did not re-appear, and at length Chên
grew anxious to see her again, and asked where she was.
Miss Pai told him her sister was afraid of strangers, and
Chên then got up and took his leave in spite of their
efforts to detain him. “If you want to see Yün-ch‘i you
had better come again to-morrow,” said Miss Pai; and
<span class="pagenum" title="i-264"><a id="Page_i-264"></a></span>
Chên, who went home thinking of nothing but Yün-ch‘i,
did return to the temple on the following day. All the
nuns were there except Yün-ch‘i, but he hardly liked to
begin by inquiring after her; and then they pressed him
to stay and take dinner with them, accepting no excuses,
Miss Pai herself setting food and chop-sticks before him,
and urging him to eat. When he asked where Yün-ch‘i
was, they said she would come directly; but evening
gradually drew on and Chên rose to go home. Thereupon
they all entreated him to stay, promising that if he
did so they would make Yün-ch‘i come in. Chên then
agreed to remain; the lamps were lighted, and wine was
freely served round, until at last he said he was so tipsy
he couldn’t take any more. “Three bumpers more,”
cried Miss Pai, “and then we will send for Yün-ch‘i.”
So Chên drank off his three cups, whereupon Miss Liang
said he must also drink three with her, which he did,
turning his wine-cup down on the table<a id="Anchor-224" title="Go to Footnote 224" href="#Footnote-224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> and declaring
that he would have no more. “The gentleman won’t
condescend to drink with us,” said Miss Pai to Miss
Liang, “so you had better call in Yün-ch‘i, and tell the
fair Eloïsa that her Abelard is awaiting her.” In a few
moments Miss Liang came back and told Chên that
Yün-ch‘i would not appear; upon which he went off in a
huff, without saying a word to either of them, and for
several days did not go near the place again. He could
<span class="pagenum" title="i-265"><a id="Page_i-265"></a></span>
not, however, forget Yün-ch‘i, and was always hanging
about on the watch, until one afternoon he observed
Miss Pai go out, at which he was delighted, for he wasn’t
much afraid of Miss Liang, and at once ran up to the
temple and knocked at the door. Yün-mien answered
his knock, and from her he discovered that Miss Liang
had also gone out on business. He then asked for
Yün-ch‘i, and Yün-mien led him into another court-yard,
where she called out, “Yün-ch‘i! here’s a visitor.” At
this the door of the room was immediately slammed,
and Yün-mien laughed and told Chên she had locked
herself in. Chên was on the point of saying something,
when Yün-mien moved away, and a voice was heard
from the other side of the window, “They all declare
I’m setting my cap at you, Sir; and if you come here
again, I cannot answer for my safety. I do not wish to
remain a nun, and if I could only meet with a gentleman
like you, Mr. P‘an, I would be a handmaid to him all
the days of my life.” Chên offered his hand and heart
to the young lady on the spot; but she reminded him
that her education for the priesthood had not been
accomplished without expense, “and if you truly love
me,” added she, “bring twenty ounces of silver wherewith
to purchase my freedom. I will wait for you three
years with the utmost fidelity.” Chên assented to this,
and was about to tell her who he really was, when
Yün-mien returned and they all went out together, Chên
now bidding them farewell and going back to his grandmother’s.
After this he always had Yün-ch‘i in his
thoughts, and wanted very much to get another interview
<span class="pagenum" title="i-266"><a id="Page_i-266"></a></span>
with her and be near her once again, but at this juncture
he heard that his father was dangerously ill, and promptly
set off on his way home, travelling day and night. His
father died, and his mother who then ruled the household
was such a severe person that he dared not tell her
what was nearest to his heart. Meanwhile he scraped
together all the money he could; and refused all proposals
of marriage on the score of being in mourning
for his father.<a id="Anchor-225" title="Go to Footnote 225" href="#Footnote-225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> His mother, however, insisted on his
taking a wife; and he then told her that when he was
with his grandmother at Huang-kang, an arrangement
had been made that he was to marry a Miss Ch‘ên, to
which he himself was quite ready to accede; and that
now, although his father’s death had stopped all communications
on the subject, he could hardly do better
than pay a visit to his grandmother and see how matters
stood, promising that if the affair was not actually settled
he would obey his mother’s commands. His mother
consented to this, and off he started with the money he
had saved; but when he reached Huang-kang and went
off to the temple, he found the place desolate and no
longer what it had been. Entering in, he saw only one
old priestess employed in cooking her food; and on
making inquiries of her, she told him that the Abbess
had died in the previous year, and that the four nuns
had gone away in different directions. According to
<span class="pagenum" title="i-267"><a id="Page_i-267"></a></span>
her, Yün-ch‘i was living in the northern quarter of the
city, and thither he proceeded forthwith; but after
asking for her at all the temples in the neighbourhood,
he could get no news of her, and returned sorrowfully
home, pretending to his mother that his uncle had said
Mr. Ch‘ên had gone away, and that as soon as he came
back they would send a servant to let him know.</p>

<p>Some months after these events, Chên’s mother went
on a visit to her own home, and mentioned this story in
conversation with her old mother, who, to her astonishment,
knew nothing at all about it, but suggested that
Chên and his uncle must have concocted the thing together.
Luckily, however, for Chên his uncle was away
at that time, and they had no means of getting at the
real truth. Meanwhile, Chên’s mother went away to the
Lily Hill to fulfil a vow she had made, and remained all
night at an inn at the foot of the hill. That evening the
landlord knocked at her door and ushered in a young
priestess to share the room. The girl said her name
was Yün-ch‘i; and when she heard that Chên’s mother
lived at I-ling, she went and sat by her side, and poured
out to her a long tale of tribulation, finishing up by
saying that she had a cousin named P‘an, at I-ling, and
begging Chên’s mother to send some one to tell him
where she would be found. “Every day I suffer,” added
she, “and each day seems like a year. Tell him to
come quickly, or I may be gone.” Chên’s mother
inquired what his other name might be, but she said she
did not know; to which the old lady replied that it was
of no consequence, as, being a graduate, it would be
<span class="pagenum" title="i-268"><a id="Page_i-268"></a></span>
easy to find him out. Early in the morning Chên’s
mother bade the girl farewell, the latter again begging
her not to forget; and when she reached home she told
Chên what had occurred. Chên threw himself on his
knees, and told his mother that he was the P‘an to whom
the young lady alluded; and after hearing how the engagement
had come about, his mother was exceedingly
angry, and said, “Undutiful boy! how will you face your
relations with a nun for a wife?” Chên hung his head
and made no reply; but shortly afterwards when he went
up for his examination, he presented himself at the
address given by Yün-ch‘i&mdash;only, however, to find that the
young lady had gone away a fortnight before. He then
returned home and fell into a bad state of health, when
his grandmother died and his mother set off to assist at
her funeral. On her way back she missed the right road
and reached the house of some people named Ching,
who turned out to be cousins of hers. They invited her
in, and there she saw a young girl of about eighteen
sitting in the parlour, and as great a beauty as she had
ever set eyes on. Now, as she was always thinking of
making a good match for her son, and curing him of his
settled melancholy, she asked who the young lady might
be; and they told her that her name was Wang,&mdash;that
she was a connection of their own, and that her father
and mother being dead, she was staying temporarily with
them. Chên’s mother inquired the name of Miss
Wang’s betrothed, but they said she was not engaged;
and then taking her hand, she entered into conversation,
and was very much charmed with her. Passing the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-269"><a id="Page_i-269"></a></span>
night there, Chên’s mother took her cousin into her confidence,
and the latter agreed that it would be a capital
match; “but,” added she, “this young lady is somewhat
ambitious, or she would hardly have remained single so
long. We must think about it.” Meanwhile, Chên’s
mother and Miss Wang got on so extremely well together
that they were already on the terms of mother and
daughter; and Miss Wang was invited to accompany her
home. This invitation she readily accepted, and next
day they went back; Chên’s mother, who wished to see
her son free from his present trouble, bidding one of the
servants tell him that she had brought home a nice wife
for him; Chên did not believe this; but on peeping
through the window beheld a young lady much prettier
even than Yün-ch‘i herself. He now began to reflect
that the three years agreed upon had already expired;
that Yün-ch‘i had gone no one knew whither, and had
probably by this time found another husband; so he
had no difficulty in entertaining the thought of marrying
this young lady, and soon regained his health. His
mother then caused the young people to meet, and be
introduced to one another; saying to Miss Wang, when
her son had left the room, “Did you guess why I invited
you to come home with me?” “I did,” replied the
young lady, “but I don’t think you guessed what was
<em>my</em> object in coming. Some years ago I was betrothed
to a Mr. P‘an, of I-ling. I have heard nothing of him
for a long time. If he has found another wife I will be
your daughter-in-law; if not, I will ever regard you as
my own mother, and endeavour to repay you for your
<span class="pagenum" title="i-270"><a id="Page_i-270"></a></span>
kindness to me.” “As there is an actual engagement,”
replied Chên’s mother, “I will say no more; but when I
was at the Lily Hill there was a Taoist nun inquiring
after this Mr. P‘an, and now you again, though, as a
matter of fact, there is no Mr. P‘an in I-ling at all.”
“What!” cried Miss Wang, “are you that lady I met?
I am the person who inquired for Mr. P‘an.” “If that
is so,” replied Chên’s mother with a smile, “then your
Mr. P‘an is not far off.” “Where is he?” said she; and
then Chên’s mother bade a maid-servant lead her out to
her son and ask him. “Is your name Yün-ch‘i?” said
Chên, in great astonishment; and when the young lady
asked him how he knew it, he told her the whole story of
his pretending to be a Mr. P‘an. But when Yün-ch‘i
found out to whom she was talking, she was abashed, and
went back and told his mother, who inquired how she
came to have two names. “My real name is Wang,”
replied the young lady; “but the old Abbess, being very
fond of me, made me take her own name.” Chên’s
mother was overjoyed at all this, and an auspicious day
was immediately fixed for the celebration of their
marriage.</p>

<h2><a id="chapter-38"><abbr title="Thirty-Eight">XXXVIII.</abbr>
<br/>
THE YOUNG LADY OF THE TUNG-T‘ING
LAKE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">The</span> spirits of the Tung-t‘ing lake<a id="Anchor-226" title="Go to Footnote 226" href="#Footnote-226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> are very much in
the habit of borrowing boats. Sometimes the cable of
an empty junk will cast itself off, and away goes the
vessel over the waves to the sound of music in the air
above. The boatmen crouch down in one corner and
hide their faces, not daring to look up until the trip is
over and they are once more at their old anchorage.</p>

<p>Now a certain Mr. Lin, returning home after having
failed at the examination for Master’s degree, was lying
down very tipsy on the deck of his boat, when suddenly
strains of music and singing began to be heard. The
boatmen shook Mr. Lin, but failing to rouse him, ran
down and hid themselves in the hold below. Then
some one came and lifted him up, letting him drop
again on to the deck, where he was allowed to remain
in the same drunken sleep as before. By-and-by the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-272"><a id="Page_i-272"></a></span>
noise of the various instruments became almost deafening,
and Lin, partially waking up, smelt a delicious
odour of perfumes filling the air around him. Opening
his eyes, he saw that the boat was crowded with a
number of beautiful girls; and knowing that something
strange was going on, he pretended to be fast asleep.
There was then a call for Chih-ch‘eng, upon which a
young waiting-maid came forward and stood quite
close to Mr. Lin’s head. Her stockings were the
colour of the kingfisher’s wing, and her feet encased in
tiny purple shoes, no bigger than one’s finger. Much
smitten with this young lady, he took hold of her stocking
with his teeth, causing her, the next time she moved,
to fall forward flat on her face. Some one, evidently in
authority, asked what was the matter; and when he
heard the explanation, was very angry, and gave orders
to take off Mr. Lin’s head. Soldiers now came and
bound Lin, and on getting up he beheld a man sitting
with his face to the south, and dressed in the garments
of a king. “Sire,” cried Lin, as he was being led
away, “the king of the Tung-t‘ing lake was a mortal
named Lin; your servant’s name is Lin also. His
Majesty was a disappointed candidate; your servant is
one too. His Majesty met the Dragon Lady, and was
made immortal; your servant has played a trick upon
this girl, and he is to die. Why this inequality of
fortunes?” When the king heard this, he bade them
bring him back, and asked him, saying, “Are you, then,
a disappointed candidate?” Lin said he was; whereupon
the king handed him writing materials, and ordered
<span class="pagenum" title="i-273"><a id="Page_i-273"></a></span>
him to compose an ode upon a lady’s head-dress.
Some time passed before Lin, who was a scholar of
some repute in his own neighbourhood, had done more
than sit thinking about what he should write; and at
length the king upbraided him, saying, “Come, come,
a man of your reputation should not take so long.”
“Sire,” replied Lin, laying down his pen, “it took ten
years to complete the Songs of the Three Kingdoms;
whereby it may be known that the value of compositions
depends more upon the labour given to them
than the speed with which they are written.” The
king laughed and waited patiently from early morning till
noon, when a copy of the verses was put into his
hand, with which he declared himself very pleased.
He now commanded that Lin should be served with
wine; and shortly after there followed a collation of
all kinds of curious dishes, in the middle of which
an officer came in and reported that the register of
people to be drowned had been made up. “How
many in all?” asked the king. “Two hundred and
twenty-eight,” was the reply; and then the king inquired
who had been deputed to carry it out; whereupon he
was informed that the generals Mao and Nan had been
appointed to do the work. Lin here rose to take
leave, and the king presented him with ten ounces of
pure gold and a crystal square,<a id="Anchor-227" title="Go to Footnote 227" href="#Footnote-227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> telling him that it
would preserve him from any danger he might encounter
<span class="pagenum" title="i-274"><a id="Page_i-274"></a></span>
on the lake. At this moment the king’s retinue and
horses ranged themselves in proper order upon the
surface of the lake; and His Majesty, stepping from
the boat into his sedan-chair, disappeared from view.</p>

<p>When everything had been quiet for a long time, the
boatmen emerged from the hold, and proceeded to
shape their course northwards. The wind, however, was
against them, and they were unable to make any headway;
when all of a sudden an iron cat appeared floating
on the top of the water. “General Mao has come,” cried
the boatmen, in great alarm; and they and all the
passengers on board fell down on their faces. Immediately
afterwards a great wooden beam stood up from
the lake, nodding itself backwards and forwards, which
the boatmen, more frightened than ever, said was
General Nan. Before long a tremendous sea was
raging, the sun was darkened in the heavens, and every
vessel in sight was capsized. But Mr. Lin sat in the
middle of the boat, with the crystal square in his hand,
and the mighty waves broke around without doing them
any harm. Thus were they saved, and Lin returned
home; and whenever he told his wonderful story he
would assert that, although unable to speak positively as
to the facial beauty of the young lady he had seen, he
dared say that she had the most exquisite pair of feet in
the world.</p>

<p>Subsequently, having occasion to visit the city of
Wu-ch‘ang, he heard of an old woman who wished to
sell her daughter, but was unwilling to accept money,
giving out that any one who had the fellow of a certain
<span class="pagenum" title="i-275"><a id="Page_i-275"></a></span>
crystal square in her possession should be at liberty to
take the girl. Lin thought this very strange; and
taking his square with him sought out the old woman,
who was delighted to see him, and told her daughter
to come in. The young lady was about fifteen years of
age, and possessed of surpassing beauty; and after
saying a few words of greeting, she turned round and
went within again. Lin’s reason had almost fled at the
sight of this peerless girl, and he straightway informed
the old woman that he had such an article as she required,
but could not say whether it would match hers
or not. So they compared their squares together, and
there was not a fraction of difference between them,
either in length or breadth. The old woman was
overjoyed, and inquiring where Lin lived, bade him go
home and get a bridal chair, leaving his square behind
him as a pledge of his good faith. This he refused to
do; but the old woman laughed, and said, “You are too
cautious, Sir; do you think I should run away for a
square?” Lin was thus constrained to leave it behind
him, and hurrying away for a chair, made the best of
his way back. When, however, he got there, the old
woman was gone. In great alarm he inquired of the
people who lived near as to her whereabouts; no one,
however, knew; and it being already late he returned
disconsolately to his boat. On the way, he met a chair
coming towards him, and immediately the screen was
drawn aside, and a voice cried out, “Mr. Lin! why so
late?” Looking closely, he saw that it was the old
woman, who, after asking him if he hadn’t suspected
<span class="pagenum" title="i-276"><a id="Page_i-276"></a></span>
her of playing him false, told him that just after he
left she had had the offer of a chair; and knowing that
he, being only a stranger in the place, would have some
trouble in obtaining one, she had sent her daughter
on to his boat. Lin then begged she would return with
him, to which she would not consent; and accordingly,
not fully trusting what she said, he hurried on himself
as fast as he could, and, jumping into the boat, found
the young lady already there. She rose to meet him
with a smile, and then he was astonished to see that
her stockings were the colour of a kingfisher’s wing, her
shoes purple, and her appearance generally like that of
the girl he had met on the Tung-t‘ing lake. While he
was still confused, the young lady remarked, “You
stare, Sir, as if you had never seen me before!” but
just then Lin noticed the tear in her stocking made by his
own teeth, and cried out in amazement, “What! are you
Chih-ch‘eng?” The young lady laughed at this; whereupon
Lin rose, and, making her a profound bow, said,
“If you are that divine creature, I pray you tell me at
once, and set my anxiety at rest.” “Sir,” replied she, “I
will tell you all. That personage you met on the boat
was actually the king of the Tung-t‘ing lake. He was
so pleased with your talent that he wished to bestow me
upon you; but, because I was a great favourite with
Her Majesty the Queen, he went back to consult with
her. I have now come at the Queen’s own command.”
Lin was highly pleased; and washing his hands, burnt
incense, with his face towards the lake, as if it were the
Imperial Court, and then they went home together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="i-277"><a id="Page_i-277"></a></span>Subsequently, when Lin had occasion to go to Wu-ch‘ang,
his wife asked to be allowed to avail herself of
the opportunity to visit her parents; and when they
reached the lake, she drew a hair-pin from her hair, and
threw it into the water. Immediately a boat rose from
the lake, and Lin’s wife, stepping into it, vanished from
sight like a bird on the wing. Lin remained waiting for
her on the prow of his vessel, at the spot where she had
disappeared; and by-and-by, he beheld a house-boat
approach, from the window of which there flew a beautiful
bird which was no other than Chih-ch‘eng. Then
some one handed out from the same window gold and
silk, and precious things in great abundance, all presents
to them from the Queen. After this, Chih-ch‘eng went
home regularly twice every year, and Lin soon became
a very rich man, the things he had being such as no one
had ever before seen or heard of.</p>

THE MAN WHO WAS CHANGED INTO
A CROW.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Yü Jung</span> was a Hu-nan man. The person who
told me his story did not recollect from what department
or district he came. His family was very poor; and
once, when returning home after failure at the examination,
he ran quite out of funds. Being ashamed to
beg, and feeling uncomfortably hungry, he turned to rest
awhile in the Wu Wang<a id="Anchor-228" title="Go to Footnote 228" href="#Footnote-228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> temple, where he poured out
all his sorrows at the feet of the God. His prayers
over, he was about to lie down in the outer porch, when
suddenly a man took him and led him into the presence
of Wu Wang; and then, falling on his knees, said,
“Your Majesty, there is a vacancy among the black-robes;
the appointment might be bestowed on this
man.” The King assented, and Yü received a suit of
black clothes; and when he had put these on he was
changed into a crow, and flew away. Outside he saw a
number of fellow-crows collected together, and immediately
joined them, settling with them on the masts of
the boats, and imitating them in catching and eating the

meat or cakes which the passengers and boatmen on
board threw up to them in the air.<a id="Anchor-229" title="Go to Footnote 229" href="#Footnote-229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> In a little while he
was no longer hungry, and, soaring aloft, alighted on the
top of a tree quite satisfied with his change of condition.
Two or three days passed, and the King, now pitying his
solitary state, provided him with a very elegant mate,
whose name was Chu-ch‘ing, and who took every opportunity
of warning him when he exposed himself too
much in search of food. However, he did not pay
much attention to this, and one day a soldier shot him
in the breast with a cross-bow; but luckily Chu-ch‘ing
got away with him in her beak, and he was not captured.
This enraged the other crows very much, and
with their wings they flapped the water into such big
waves that all the boats were upset. Chu-ch‘ing now
procured food and fed her husband; but his wound was
a severe one, and by the end of the day he was dead&mdash;at
which moment he waked, as it were, from a dream,
and found himself lying in the temple.</p>

<p>The people of the place had found Mr. Yü to all appearance
dead; and not knowing how he had come by
his death, and finding that his body was not quite cold,
had set some one to watch him. They now learnt what
had happened to him, and making up a purse between
them, sent him away home. Three years afterwards he
<span class="pagenum" title="i-280"><a id="Page_i-280"></a></span>
was passing by the same spot, and went in to worship at
the temple; also preparing a quantity of food, and
inviting the crows to come down and eat it. He then
prayed, saying, “If Chu-ch‘ing is among you, let her
remain.” When the crows had eaten the food they all
flew away; and by-and-by Yü returned, having succeeded
in obtaining his master’s degree. Again he visited Wu
Wang’s temple, and sacrificed a calf as a feast for the
crows; and again he prayed as on the previous occasion.
That night he slept on the lake, and, just as the candles
were lighted and he had sat down, suddenly there was a
noise as of birds settling, and lo! some twenty beautiful
young ladies stood before him. “Have you been quite
well since we parted?” asked one of them; to which
Yü replied that he should like to know whom he had the
honour of addressing. “Don’t you remember Chu-ch‘ing?”
said the young lady; and then Yü was overjoyed,
and inquired how she had come. “I am now,”
replied Chu-ch‘ing, “a spirit of the Han river, and seldom
go back to my old home; but in consequence of
what you did on two occasions, I have come to see you
once more.” They then sat talking together like husband
and wife reunited after long absence, and Yü
proposed that she should return with him on his way
south. Chu-ch‘ing, however, said she must go west
again, and upon this point they could not come to any
agreement. Next morning, when Yü waked up, he found
himself in a lofty room with two large candles burning
brightly, and no longer in his own boat. In utter
amazement he arose and asked where he was. “At
<span class="pagenum" title="i-281"><a id="Page_i-281"></a></span>
Han-yang,” replied Chu-ch‘ing; “my home is your
home; why need you go south?” By-and-by, when it
got lighter, in came a number of serving-women with
wine, which they placed on a low table on the top of a
broad couch; and then husband and wife sat down to
drink together. “Where are all my servants?” asked
Yü; and when he heard they were still on the boat, he
said he was afraid the boat people would not be able to
wait. “Never mind,” replied Chu-ch‘ing; “I have
plenty of money, and I’ll help you to make it up to
them.” Yü therefore remained with her, feasting and
enjoying himself, and forgetting all about going home.
As for the boatmen, when they waked up and found
themselves at Han-yang, they were greatly astonished;
and, seeing that the servants could find no trace of their
missing master, they wished to go about their own business.
They were unable, however, to undo the cable,
and so they all remained there together for more than a
couple of months, by the end of which time Mr. Yü
became anxious to return home, and said to Chu-ch‘ing,
“If I stay here, my family connections will be completely
severed. Besides, as we are husband and wife, it
is only right that you should pay a visit to my home.”
“That,” replied Chu-ch‘ing, “I cannot do; and even
were I able to go, you have a wife there already, and
where would you put me? It is better for me to stop
where I am, and thus you will have a second family.”
Yü said she would be so far off that he could not always
be dropping in; whereupon Chu-ch‘ing produced a black
suit, and replied, “Here are your old clothes. Whenever
<span class="pagenum" title="i-282"><a id="Page_i-282"></a></span>
you want to see me, put these on and come, and on your
arrival I will take them off for you.” She then prepared
a parting feast for her husband, at which he got very
tipsy; and when he waked up he was on board his boat
again, and at his old anchorage on the lake. The boatmen
and his servants were all there, and they looked at
one another in mutual amazement; and when they asked
Yü where he had been, he hardly knew what to say. By
the side of his pillow he discovered a bundle in which
were some new clothes Chu-ch‘ing had given him, shoes,
stockings, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; and folded up with them was the suit
of black. In addition to these he found an embroidered
belt for tying round the waist, which was stuffed full of
gold. He now started on his way south, and, when he
reached the end of his journey, dismissed the boatmen
with a handsome present.</p>

<p>After being at home for some months, his thoughts
reverted to Han-yang; and, taking out the black clothes,
he put them on, when wings immediately grew from his
ribs, and with a flap he was gone. In about four hours
he arrived at Han-yang, and, wheeling round and round
in the air, espied below him a solitary islet, on which
stood a house, and there he proceeded to alight. A
maid-servant had already seen him coming, and cried
out, “Here’s master!” and in a few moments out came
Chu-ch‘ing, and bade the attendants take off Mr. Yü’s
feathers. They were not long in setting him free, and
then, hand in hand, he and Chu-ch‘ing went into the
house together. “You have come at a happy moment,”
said his wife, as they sat down to tell each other all the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-283"><a id="Page_i-283"></a></span>
news; and in three days’ time she gave birth to a boy,
whom they called Han-ch‘an, which means “born on the
Han river.” Three days after the event all the river-nymphs
came to congratulate them, and brought many
handsome presents. They were a charming band, not
one being over thirty years of age; and, going into the
bedroom and approaching the bed, each one pressed her
thumb on the baby’s nose, saying, “Long life to thee,
little one!” Yü asked who they all were, and Chu-ch‘ing
told him they belonged to the same family of spirits as
herself; “And the two last of all,” said she, “dressed in
white like the lily, are the nymphs who gave away their
girdles at Hankow.”<a id="Anchor-230" title="Go to Footnote 230" href="#Footnote-230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>A few months passed away, and then Chu-ch‘ing sent
her husband back in a boat to his old home. No sails
or oars were used, but the boat sped along of itself; and
at the end of the river journey there were men waiting
with horses to convey him to his own door. After this
he went backwards and forwards very frequently; and in
time Han-ch‘an grew up to be a fine boy, the apple of his
father’s eye. Unhappily his first wife had no children,
and she was extremely anxious to see Han-ch‘an; so Yü
communicated this to Chu-ch‘ing, who at once packed
up a box and sent him back with his father, on the
understanding that he was to return in three months.
<span class="pagenum" title="i-284"><a id="Page_i-284"></a></span>
However, the other wife became quite as fond of him as
if he had been her own child, and ten months passed
without her being able to bear the thought of parting
with him. But one day Han-ch‘an was taken violently
ill, and died; upon which Yü’s wife was overwhelmed
with grief, and wished to die too. Yü then set off for
Han-yang, to carry the tidings to Chu-ch‘ing; and when
he arrived, lo! there was Han-ch‘an, with his shoes and
socks off, lying on the bed. He was greatly rejoiced at
this, and asked Chu-ch‘ing what it all meant. “Why,”
replied she, “the term agreed upon by us had long
expired, and, as I wanted my boy, I sent for him.” Yü
then told her how much his other wife loved Han-ch‘an,
but Chu-ch‘ing said she must wait until there was another
child, and then she should have him. Later on Chu-ch‘ing
had twins, a boy and a girl, the former named
Han-shêng and the latter Yü-p‘ei; whereupon Han-ch‘an
went back again with his father, who, finding it inconvenient
to be travelling backwards and forwards three or
four times in a year, removed with his family to the city
of Han-yang. At twelve years of age Han-ch‘an took
his bachelor’s degree; and his mother, thinking there
was no girl among mortals good enough for her son, sent
for him to come home, that she herself might find a wife
for him, which she did in the person of a Miss Chih-niang,
who was the daughter of a spirit like herself. Yü’s
first wife then died, and the three children all went to
mourn her loss, Han-ch‘an remaining in Hu-nan after
the funeral, but the other two returning with their father,
and not leaving their mother again.</p>

<br/>
THE FLOWER NYMPHS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> the lower temple on Mount Lao the camellias<a id="Anchor-231" title="Go to Footnote 231" href="#Footnote-231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
are twenty feet in height, and many spans in circumference.
The peonies are more than ten feet high;
and when the flowers are in bloom the effect is that of
gorgeous tapestry.</p>

<p>There was a Mr. Huang, of Chiao-chow, who built
himself a house at that spot, for the purposes of study;
and one day he saw from his window a young lady
dressed in white wandering about amongst the flowers.
Reflecting that she could not possibly belong to the
monastery,<a id="Anchor-232" title="Go to Footnote 232" href="#Footnote-232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> he went out to meet her, but she had
already disappeared. After this he frequently observed
her, and once hid himself in a thick-foliaged bush,
waiting for her to come. By-and-by she appeared,
bringing with her another young lady dressed in red,
who, as he noticed from his distant point of observation,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-286"><a id="Page_i-286"></a></span>
was an exceedingly good-looking girl. When
they approached nearer, the young lady in the red
dress ran back, saying, “There is a man here!”
whereupon Mr. Huang jumped out upon them, and
away they went in a scare, with their skirts and long
sleeves fluttering in the breeze, and perfuming the air
around. Huang pursued them as far as a low wall,
where they suddenly vanished from his gaze. In
great distress at thus losing the fair creatures, he took
a pencil and wrote upon a tree the following <span class="nowrap">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse_i-0-5">“The pangs of love my heart enthrall</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">As I stand opposite this wall.</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">I dread some hateful tyrant’s power,</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">With none to save you in that hour.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Returning home he was absorbed in his own
thoughts, when all at once the young lady walked in,
and he rose up joyfully to meet her. “I thought you
were a brigand,” said his visitor, smiling; “you nearly
frightened me to death. I did not know you were a
great scholar whose acquaintance I now hope to have
the honour of making.” Mr. Huang asked the young
lady her name, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, to which she replied, “My name
is Hsiang-yü, and I belong to P‘ing-k‘ang-hsiang; but
a magician has condemned me to remain on this hill
much against my own inclination.” “Tell me his
name,” cried Huang, “and I’ll soon set you free.”
“There is no need for that,” answered the young lady;
“I suffer no injury from him, and the place is not an
inconvenient one for making the acquaintance of such
<span class="pagenum" title="i-287"><a id="Page_i-287"></a></span>
worthy gentlemen as yourself.” Huang then inquired
who was the young lady in red, and she told him that
her name was Chiang-hsüeh, and that they were half-sisters;
“and now,” added she, “I will sing you a song;
but please don’t laugh at me.” She then began as
<span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse_i-0-5">“In pleasant company the hours fly fast,</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">And through the window daybreak peeps at last.</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">Ah, would that, like the swallow and his mate,</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">To live together were our happy fate.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Huang here grasped her hand<a id="Anchor-233" title="Go to Footnote 233" href="#Footnote-233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> and said, “Beauty
without and intellect within&mdash;enough to make a man
love you and forget all about death, regarding one day’s
absence like the separation of a thousand years. I
pray you come again whenever an opportunity may
present itself.” From this time the young lady would
<span class="pagenum" title="i-288"><a id="Page_i-288"></a></span>
frequently walk in to have a chat, but would never bring
her sister with her in spite of all Mr. Huang’s entreaties.
Huang thought they weren’t friends, but Hsiang said her
sister did not care for society in the same way that she
herself did, promising at the same time to try and
persuade her to come at some future day. One evening
Hsiang-yü arrived in a melancholy frame of mind, and
told Huang that he was wanting more when he couldn’t
even keep what he had got; “for to-morrow,” said she,
“we part.” Huang asked what she meant; and then
wiping away her tears with her sleeve, Hsiang-yü declared
it was destiny, and that she couldn’t well tell him.
“Your former prophecy,” continued she, “has come too
true; and now it may well be said of <span class="nowrap">me&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse_i-0-5">‘Fallen into the tyrant’s power,</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">With none to save me in that hour.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Huang again tried to question her, but she would tell
him nothing; and by-and-by she rose and took her
leave. This seemed very strange; however, next day
a visitor came, who, after wandering round the garden,
was much taken with a white peony,<a id="Anchor-234" title="Go to Footnote 234" href="#Footnote-234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> which he dug
up and carried away with him. Huang now awaked to
the fact that Hsiang-yü was a flower nymph, and became
very disconsolate in consequence of what had happened;
but when he subsequently heard that the peony only
<span class="pagenum" title="i-289"><a id="Page_i-289"></a></span>
lived a few days after being taken away, he wept bitterly,
and composed an elegy in fifty stanzas, besides going
daily to the hole from which it had been taken, and
watering the ground with his tears. One day, as he was
returning thence, he espied the young lady of the red
clothes also wiping away her tears alongside the hole,
and immediately walked back gently towards her. She
did not run away, and Huang, grasping her sleeve,
joined with her in her lamentations. When these were
concluded he invited her to his house, and then she
burst out with a sigh, saying, “Alas! that the sister of
my early years should be thus suddenly taken from me.
Hearing you, Sir, mourn as you did, I have also been
moved to tears. Those you shed have sunk down deep
to the realms below, and may perhaps succeed in
restoring her to us; but the sympathies of the dead are
destroyed for ever, and how then can she laugh and talk
with us again?” “My luck is bad,” said Huang, “that
I should injure those I love, neither can I have the good
fortune to draw towards me another such a beauty.
But tell me, when I often sent messages by Hsiang-yü to
you, why did you not come?” “I knew,” replied she,
“what nine young fellows out of ten are; but I did not
know what you were.” She then took leave, Huang
telling her how dull he felt without Hsiang-yü, and
begging her to come again. For some days she did not
appear; and Huang remained in a state of great melancholy,
tossing and turning on his bed and wetting the
pillow with his tears, until one night he got up, put
on his clothes, and trimmed the lamp; and having
<span class="pagenum" title="i-290"><a id="Page_i-290"></a></span>
called for pen and ink, he composed the following
<span class="nowrap">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse_i-0-5">“On my cottage roof the evening raindrops beat;</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">I draw the blind and near the window take my seat.</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">To my longing gaze no loved one appears;</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">Drip, drip, drip, drip: fast flow my tears.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>This he read aloud; and when he had finished, a
voice outside said, “You want some one to cap your
verses there!” Listening attentively, he knew it was
Chiang-hsüeh; and opening the door he let her in. She
looked at his stanza, and added <span class="nowrap">impromptu&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse_i-0-5">“She is no longer in the room;</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">A single lamp relieves the gloom;</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">One solitary man is there;</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">He and his shadow make a pair.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>As Huang read these words his tears fell fast; and
then, turning to Chiang-hsüeh, he upbraided her for not
having been to see him. “I can’t come so often as
Hsiang-yü did,” replied she, “but only now and then
when you are very dull.” After this she used to drop in
occasionally, and Huang said Hsiang-yü was his beloved
wife, and she his dear friend, always trying to find out
every time she came which flower in the garden she was,
that he might bring her home with him, and save her
from the fate of Hsiang-yü. “The old earth should not
be disturbed,” said she, “and it would not do any good
to tell you. If you couldn’t keep your wife always with
you, how will you be sure of keeping a friend?”
<span class="pagenum" title="i-291"><a id="Page_i-291"></a></span>
Huang, however, paid no heed to this, and seizing her
arm, led her out into the garden, where he stopped at
every peony and asked if this was the one; to which
Chiang-hsüeh made no reply, but only put her hand to
her mouth and laughed.</p>

<p>At New Year’s time Huang went home, and a couple
of months afterwards he dreamt that Chiang-hsüeh came
to tell him she was in great trouble, begging him to
hurry off as soon as possible to her rescue. When he
woke up, he thought his dream a very strange one; and
ordering his servant and horses to be ready, started at
once for the hills. There he found that the priests were
about to build a new room; and finding a camellia in
the way, the contractor had given orders that it should
be cut down. Huang now understood his dream, and
immediately took steps to prevent the destruction of the
flower. That night Chiang-hsüeh came to thank him,
and Huang laughed and said, “It serves you right for
not telling me which you were. Now I know you, and
if you don’t come and see me, I’ll get a firebrand and
make it hot for you.” “That’s just why I didn’t tell you
before,” replied she. “The presence of my dear friend,”
said Huang, after a pause, “makes me think more of my
lost wife. It is long since I have mourned for her.
Shall we go and bemoan her loss together?” So they
went off and shed many a tear on the spot where
formerly Hsiang-yü had stood, until at last Chiang-hsüeh
wiped her eyes and said it was time to go. A few
evenings later Huang was sitting alone when suddenly
Chiang-hsüeh entered, her face radiant with smiles.
<span class="pagenum" title="i-292"><a id="Page_i-292"></a></span>
“Good news!” cried she, “the Flower-God,<a id="Anchor-235" title="Go to Footnote 235" href="#Footnote-235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> moved
by your tears, has granted Hsiang-yü a return to life.”
Huang was overjoyed, and asked when she would come;
to which Chiang-hsüeh replied, that she could not say
for certain, but that it would not be long. “I came here
on your account,” said Huang; “don’t let me be duller
than you can help.” “All right,” answered she, and
then went away, not returning for the next two evenings.
Huang then went into the garden and threw his arms
around her plant, entreating her to come and see him,
though without eliciting any response. He accordingly
went back, and began twisting up a torch, when all at
once in she came, and snatching the torch out of his
hand, threw it away, saying, “You’re a bad fellow, and I
don’t like you, and I shan’t have any more to do with you.”
However, Huang soon succeeded in pacifying her, and
by-and-by in walked Hsiang-yü herself. Huang now
wept tears of joy as he seized her hand, and drawing
Chiang-hsüeh towards them, the three friends mingled
their tears together. They then sat down and talked over
the miseries of separation, Huang meanwhile noticing
that Hsiang-yü seemed to be unsubstantial, and that
when he grasped her hand his fingers seemed to close
<span class="pagenum" title="i-293"><a id="Page_i-293"></a></span>
only on themselves, and not as in the days gone by.
This Hsiang-yü explained, saying, “When I was a
flower-nymph I had a body; but now I am only the
disembodied spirit of that flower. Do not regard me
as a reality, but rather as an apparition seen in a
dream.” “You have come at the nick of time,” cried
Chiang-hsüeh; “your husband there was just getting
troublesome.” Hsiang-yü now instructed Huang to take
a little powdered white-berry, and mixing it with some
sulphur, to pour out a libation to her, adding, “This day
next year I will return your kindness.” The young
ladies then went away, and next day Huang observed
the shoots of a young peony growing up where Hsiang-yü
had once stood. So he made the libation as she
had told him, and had the plant very carefully tended,
even building a fence all round to protect it. Hsiang-yü
came to thank him for this, and he proposed that the
plant should be removed to his own home; but to this
she would not agree, “for,” said she, “I am not very
strong, and could not stand being transplanted. Besides,
all things have their appointed place; and as I
was not originally intended for your home, it might
shorten my life to be sent there. We can love each
other very well here.” Huang then asked why Chiang-hsüeh
did not come; to which Hsiang-yü replied that
they must make her, and proceeded with him into the
garden, where, after picking a blade of grass, she
measured upwards from the roots of Chiang-hsüeh’s
plant to a distance of four feet six inches, at which
point she stopped, and Huang began to scratch a mark
<span class="pagenum" title="i-294"><a id="Page_i-294"></a></span>
on the place with his nails. At that moment Chiang-hsüeh
came from behind the plant, and in mock anger
cried out, “You hussy you! what do you aid that
wretch for?” “Don’t be angry, my dear,” said
Hsiang-yü; “help me to amuse him for a year only,
and then you shan’t be bothered any more.” So they
went on, Huang watching the plant thrive, until by the
spring it was over two feet in height. He then went
home, giving the priests a handsome present, and
bidding them take great care of it. Next year, in the
fourth moon, he returned and found upon the plant a
bud just ready to break; and as he was walking round,
the stem shook violently as if it would snap, and suddenly
the bud opened into a flower as large as a plate,
disclosing a beautiful maiden within, sitting upon one
of the pistils, and only a few inches in height. In the
twinkling of an eye she had jumped out, and lo! it
was Hsiang-yü. “Through the wind and the rain I
have waited for you,” cried she; “why have you come
so late?” They then went into the house, where they
found Chiang-hsüeh already arrived, and sat down to
enjoy themselves as they had done in former times.
Shortly afterwards Huang’s wife died, and he took up his
abode at Mount Lao for good and all. The peonies
were at that time as large round as one’s arm; and
whenever Huang went to look at them, he always said,
“Some day my spirit will be there by your side;” to
which the two girls used to reply with a laugh, and
say, “Mind you don’t forget.” Ten years after these
events, Huang became dangerously ill, and his son,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-295"><a id="Page_i-295"></a></span>
who had come to see him, was very much distressed
about him. “I am about to be born,” cried his
father; “I am not going to die. Why do you weep?”
He also told the priests that if later on they should
see a red shoot, with five leaves, thrusting itself forth
alongside of the peony, that would be himself. This was
all he said, and his son proceeded to convey him home,
where he died immediately on arrival. Next year a
shoot did come up exactly as he had mentioned; and
the priests, struck by the coincidence, watered it and
supplied it with earth. In three years it was a tall
plant, and a good span in circumference, but without
flowers. When the old priest died, the others took no
care of it; and as it did not flower they cut it down.
The white peony then faded and died; and before long
the camellia was dead too.</p>

<br/>
TA-NAN IN SEARCH OF HIS FATHER.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Hsi Ch‘êng-lieh</span> was a Ch‘êng-tu man. He had a wife
and a concubine, the latter named Ho Chao-jung. His
wife dying, he took a second by name Shên, who bullied
the concubine dreadfully, and by her constant wrangling
made his life perfectly unbearable, so that one day in a
fit of anger he ran away and left them. Shortly afterwards
Ho gave birth to a son, and called him Ta-nan;
but as Hsi did not return, the wife Shên turned them out
of the house, making them a daily allowance of food.
By degrees Ta-nan became a big boy; and his mother,
not daring to ask for an increase of victuals, was obliged
to earn a little money by spinning. Meanwhile, Ta-nan,
seeing all his companions go to school and learn to read,
told his mother he should like to go too; and accordingly,
as he was still very young, she sent him for a few
days’ probation. He turned out to be so clever that he
soon beat the other boys; at which the master of the
school was much pleased, and offered to teach him for
nothing.<a id="Anchor-236" title="Go to Footnote 236" href="#Footnote-236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> His mother, therefore, sent him regularly,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-297"><a id="Page_i-297"></a></span>
making what trifling presents she could to the master;
and by the end of two or three years he had a first-rate
knowledge of the Sacred Books.<a id="Anchor-237" title="Go to Footnote 237" href="#Footnote-237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> One day he came
home and asked his mother, saying, “All the fellows at
our school get money from their fathers to buy cakes.
Why don’t I?” “Wait till you are grown up,” replied
<span class="pagenum" title="i-298"><a id="Page_i-298"></a></span>
his mother, “and I will explain it to you.” “Why,
mother,” cried he, “I’m only seven or eight years old.
What a time it will be before I’m grown up.” “Whenever
you pass the temple of the God of War on your
way to school,” said his mother, “you should go in and
pray awhile; that would make you grow faster.” Ta-nan
believed she was serious; and every day, going and
coming, he went in and worshipped at that temple.
When his mother found this out, she asked him how
soon he was praying to be grown up; to which he replied
that he only prayed that by the following year he might
be as big as if he were fifteen or sixteen years old. His
mother laughed; but Ta-nan went on, increasing in
wisdom and stature alike, until by the time he was ten,
he looked quite thirteen or fourteen, and his master was
no longer able to correct his essays. Then he said to
his mother, “You promised me that when I grew up you
would tell me where my father is. Tell me now.” “By-and-by,
by-and-by,” replied his mother; so he waited
another year, and then pressed her so eagerly to tell him
that she could no longer refuse, and related to him the
whole story. He heard her recital with tears and
lamentations, and expressed a wish to go in search of his
father; but his mother objected that he was too young,
and also that no one knew where his father was. Ta-nan
said nothing; however, in the middle of the day he did
not come home as usual, and his mother at once sent off
to the school, where she found he had not shewn himself
since breakfast. In great alarm, and thinking that he
had been playing truant, she paid some people to go and
<span class="pagenum" title="i-299"><a id="Page_i-299"></a></span>
hunt for him everywhere, but was unable to obtain the
slightest clue to his whereabouts. As to Ta-nan himself,
when he left the house he followed the road without
knowing whither he was going, until at length he met a
man who was on his way to K‘uei-chou, and said his
name was Ch‘ien. Ta-nan begged of him something to
eat, and went along with him; Mr. Ch‘ien even procuring
an animal for him to ride because he walked too slowly.
The expenses of the journey were all defrayed by Ch‘ien;
and when they arrived at K‘uei-chou they dined together,
Ch‘ien secretly putting some drug in Ta-nan’s
food which soon reduced him to a state of unconsciousness.
Ch‘ien then carried him off to a temple, and, pretending
that Ta-nan was his son, offered him to the
priests<a id="Anchor-238" title="Go to Footnote 238" href="#Footnote-238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> on the plea that he had no money to continue his
journey. The priests, seeing what a nice-looking boy he
was, were only too ready to buy him; and when Ch‘ien
had got his money he went away. They then gave
Ta-nan a draught which brought him round; but as soon
as the abbot heard of the affair and saw Ta-nan himself,
he would not allow them to keep him, sending him away
with a purse of money in his pocket. Ta-nan next met
a gentleman named Chiang, from Lu-chou, who was returning
home after having failed at the examination; and
this Mr. Chiang was so pleased with the story of his
filial piety that he took him to his own home at Lu-chou.
There he remained for a month and more, asking everybody
<span class="pagenum" title="i-300"><a id="Page_i-300"></a></span>
he saw for news of his father, until one day he was
told that there was a man named Hsi among the Fokien
traders. So he bade good-by to Mr. Chiang, and set off
for Fokien, his patron providing him with clothes and
shoes, and the people of the place making up a subscription
for him. On the road he met two traders in cotton
cloth who were going to Fu-ch‘ing, and he joined their
party; but they had not travelled many stages before
these men found out that he had money, and taking him
to a lonely spot, bound him hand and foot and made off
with all he had. Before long a Mr. Ch‘ên, of Yung-fu,
happened to pass by, and at once unbound him, and
giving him a seat in one of his own vehicles, carried him
off home. This Mr. Ch‘ên was a wealthy man, and in
his house Ta-nan had opportunities of meeting with
traders from all quarters. He therefore begged them to
aid him by making inquiries about his father, himself
remaining as a fellow student with Mr. Ch‘ên’s sons, and
roaming the country no more, neither hearing any news
of his former and now distant home.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his mother, Ho, had lived alone for three
or four years, until the wife, Shên, wishing to reduce the
expenses, tried to persuade her to find another husband.
As Ho was now supporting herself, she steadfastly refused
to do this; and then Shên sold her to a Chung-ch‘ing
trader, who took her away with him. However,
she so frightened this man by hacking herself about with
a knife, that when the wounds were healed he was only
too happy to get rid of her to a trader from Yen-t‘ing,
who in his turn, after Ho had nearly disembowelled
<span class="pagenum" title="i-301"><a id="Page_i-301"></a></span>
herself, readily listened to her repeated cries that she
wished to become a nun. However, he persuaded her
to hire herself out as housekeeper to a friend of his, as
a means of reimbursing himself for his outlay in
purchasing her; but no sooner had she set eyes on the
gentleman in question than she found it was her own
husband. For Hsi had given up the career of a scholar,
and gone into business; and as he had no wife, he was
consequently in want of a housekeeper. They were
very glad to see each other again; and on relating their
several adventures, Hsi knew for the first time that he
had a son who had gone forth in search of his father.
Hsi then asked all the traders and commercial travellers
to keep a look out for Ta-nan, at the same time raising
Ho from the status of concubine to that of wife. In
consequence, however, of the many hardships Ho had
gone through, her health was anything but good, and she
was unable to do the work of the house; so she advised
her husband to buy a concubine. This he was most unwilling
to do, remembering too well the former squabbling
he had to endure; but ultimately he yielded, asked
a friend to buy for him an oldish woman&mdash;at any rate
more than thirty years of age. A few months afterwards
his friend arrived, bringing with him a person of about
that age; and on looking closely at her, Hsi saw that she
was no other than his own wife Shên!</p>

<p>Now this lady had lived by herself for a year and more
when her brother Pao advised her to marry again, which
she accordingly agreed to do. She was prevented, however,
by the younger branches of the family from selling
<span class="pagenum" title="i-302"><a id="Page_i-302"></a></span>
the landed property; but she disposed of everything
else, and the proceeds passed into her brother’s hands.
About that time a Pao-ning trader, hearing that she had
plenty of money, bribed her brother to marry her to
himself; and afterwards, finding that she was a disagreeable
woman, took possession of everything she had, and
advertised her for sale. No one caring to buy a woman
of her age, and her master being on the eve of starting
for K‘uei-chou, took her with him, finally getting rid of
her to Hsi, who was in the same line of business as himself.
When she stood before her former husband, she
was overwhelmed with shame and fear, and had not a
word to say; but Hsi gathered an outline of what had
happened from the trader, and then said to her, “Your
second marriage with this Pao-ning gentleman was
doubtless contracted after you had given up all hope
of seeing me again. It doesn’t matter in the least, as
now I am not in search of a wife but only of a concubine.
So you had better begin by paying your
respects to your mistress here, my wife Ho Chao-jung.”
Shên was ashamed to do this: but Hsi reminded her of
the time when she had been in the wife’s place, and in
spite of all Ho’s intercession insisted that she should do
so, stimulating her to obedience by the smart application
of a stick. Shên was therefore compelled to yield, but at
the same time she never tried to gain Ho’s favour, and
kept away from her as much as possible. Ho, on the
other hand, treated her with great consideration, and
never took her to task on the performance of her duties;
whilst Hsi himself, whenever he had a dinner-party,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-303"><a id="Page_i-303"></a></span>
made her wait at table, though Ho often entreated him
to hire a maid.</p>

<p>Now the magistrate at Yen-t‘ing was named Ch‘ên
Tsung-ssŭ, and once when Hsi had some trifling difficulty
with one of the neighbours he was further accused
to this official of having forced his wife to assume the
position of concubine. The magistrate, however, refused
to take up the case, to the great satisfaction of Hsi and
his wife, who lauded him to the skies as a virtuous
mandarin. A few nights after, at rather a late hour, the
servant knocked at the door, and called out, “The
magistrate has come!” Hsi jumped up in a hurry, and
began looking for his clothes and shoes; but the magistrate
was already in the bedroom without either of
them understanding what it all meant: when suddenly
Ho, examining him closely, cried out, “It is my son!”
She then burst into tears, and the magistrate, throwing
himself on the ground, wept with his mother. It seemed
he had taken the name of the gentleman with whom he
had lived, and had since entered upon an official career.
That on his way to the capital<a id="Anchor-239" title="Go to Footnote 239" href="#Footnote-239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> he had made a <i xml:lang="fr">détour</i>
and visited his old home, where he heard to his infinite
sorrow that both his mothers had married again; and
that his relatives, finding him already a man of position,
had restored to him the family property, of which he had
left some one in charge in the hope that his father might
return. That then he had been appointed to Yen-t‘ing,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-304"><a id="Page_i-304"></a></span>
but had wished to throw up the post and travel in search
of his father, from which design he had been dissuaded
by Mr. Ch‘ên. Also that he had met a fortune-teller
from whom he had obtained the following response to
his inquiries:&mdash;“The lesser is the greater; the younger
is the elder. Seeking the cock, you find the hen; seeking
one, you get two. Your official life will be
successful.” Ch‘ên then took up his appointment, but
not finding his father he confined himself entirely to a
vegetable diet, and gave up the use of wine.<a id="Anchor-240" title="Go to Footnote 240" href="#Footnote-240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The
above-mentioned case had subsequently come under his
notice, and seeing the name Hsi, he quietly sent his
private servant to find out, and thus discovered that this
Hsi was his father. At night-fall he set off himself, and
when he saw his mother he knew that the fortune-teller
had told him true. Bidding them all say nothing to
anybody about what had occurred, he provided money
for the journey, and sent them back home. On arriving
there, they found the place newly painted, and with their
increased retinue of servants and horses, they were quite
a wealthy family. As to Shên when she found what a
great man Ta-nan had become, she put still more
restraint upon herself; but her brother Pao brought an
action for the purpose of reinstating her as wife. The
presiding official happened to be a man of probity, and
delivered the following judgment:&mdash;“Greedy of gain
you urged your sister to re-marry. After she had driven
<span class="pagenum" title="i-305"><a id="Page_i-305"></a></span>
Hsi away, she took two fresh husbands. How have you
the face to talk about reinstating her as wife?” He
thereupon ordered Pao to be severely bambooed, and
from this time there was no longer any doubt about
Shên’s <em>status</em>. She was the lesser and Ho the greater;
and yet in the matter of clothes and food Ho shewed
herself by no means grasping. Shên was at first afraid
that Ho would pay her out, and was consequently more
than ever repentant; and Hsi himself, letting by-gones
be by-gones, gave orders that Shên should be called
<em>madam</em> by all alike, though of course she was excluded
from any titles that might be gained for them by Ta-nan.<a id="Anchor-241" title="Go to Footnote 241" href="#Footnote-241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<br/>
THE WONDERFUL STONE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">In</span> the prefecture of Shun-t‘ien<a id="Anchor-242" title="Go to Footnote 242" href="#Footnote-242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> there lived a man
named Hsing Yün-fei, who was an amateur mineralogist
and would pay any price for a good specimen. One
day as he was fishing in the river, something caught
his net, and diving down he brought up a stone about
a foot in diameter, beautifully carved on all sides to
resemble clustering hills and peaks. He was quite as
pleased with this as if he had found some precious
stone; and having had an elegant sandal-wood stand
made for it, he set his prize upon the table. Whenever it
was about to rain, clouds, which from a distance looked
like new cotton wool, would come forth from each of
the holes or <a id="tn_8">grottoes</a> on the stone, and appear to close
them up. By-and-by an influential personage called
at the house and begged to see the stone, immediately
seizing it and handing it over to a lusty servant, at
the same time whipping his horse and riding away.
Hsing was in despair; but all he could do was to mourn
the loss of his stone, and indulge his anger against
<span class="pagenum" title="i-307"><a id="Page_i-307"></a></span>
the thief. Meanwhile, the servant, who had carried
off the stone on his back, stopped to rest at a bridge;
when all of a sudden his hand slipped and the stone
fell into the water. His master was extremely put out
at this, and gave him a sound beating; subsequently
hiring several divers, who tried every means in their
power to recover the stone, but were quite unable to
find it. He then went away, having first published a
notice of reward, and by these means many were
tempted to seek for the stone. Soon after, Hsing
himself came to the spot, and as he mournfully approached
the bank, lo! the water became clear, and
he could see the stone lying at the bottom. Taking
off his clothes he quickly jumped in and brought it
out, together with the sandal-wood stand which was
still with it. He carried it off home, but being no
longer desirous of shewing it to people, he had an
inner room cleaned and put it in there. Some time
afterwards an old man knocked at the door and asked
to be allowed to see the stone; whereupon Hsing replied
that he had lost it a long time ago. “Isn’t that it in
the inner room?” said the old man, smiling. “Oh,
walk in and see for yourself if you don’t believe me,”
answered Hsing; and the old man did walk in, and there
was the stone on the table. This took Hsing very much
aback; and the old man then laid his hand upon the
stone and said, “This is an old family relic of mine:
I lost it many months since. How does it come to
be here? I pray you now restore it to me.” Hsing
didn’t know what to say, but declared he was the owner
<span class="pagenum" title="i-308"><a id="Page_i-308"></a></span>
of the stone; upon which the old man remarked, “If
it is really yours, what evidence can you bring to prove
it?” Hsing made no reply; and the old man continued,
“To show you that I know this stone, I may mention
that it has altogether ninety-two grottoes, and that in the
largest of these are five <span class="nowrap">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse_i0">‘A stone from Heaven above.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Hsing looked and found that there were actually some
small characters, no larger than grains of rice, which
by straining his eyes a little he managed to read; also,
that the number of grottoes was as the old man had
said. However, he would not give him the stone; and
the old man laughed, and asked, “Pray, what right have
you to keep other people’s things?” He then bowed
and went away, Hsing escorting him as far as the door;
but when he returned to the room, the stone had
disappeared. In a great fright, he ran after the old
man, who had walked slowly and was not far off, and
seizing his sleeve entreated him to give back the stone.
“Do you think,” said the latter, “that I could conceal a
stone a foot in diameter in my sleeve?” But Hsing
knew that he must be superhuman, and led him back to
the house, where he threw himself on his knees and
begged that he might have the stone. “Is it yours
or mine?” asked the old man. “Of course it is yours,”
replied Hsing, “though I hope you will consent to deny
yourself the pleasure of keeping it.” “In that case,”
said the old man, “it is back again;” and going into
the inner room, they found the stone in its old place.
<span class="pagenum" title="i-309"><a id="Page_i-309"></a></span>
“The jewels of this world,” observed Hsing’s visitor,
“should be given to those who know how to take care
of them. This stone can choose its own master, and
I am very pleased that it should remain with you;
at the same time I must inform you that it was in
too great a hurry to come into the world of mortals,
and has not yet been freed from all contingent calamities.
I had better take it away with me, and three years
hence you shall have it again. If, however, you insist
on keeping it, then your span of life will be shortened
by three years, that your terms of existence may
harmonize together. Are you willing?” Hsing said
he was; whereupon the old man with his fingers closed
up three of the stone’s grottoes, which yielded to his
touch like mud. When this was done, he turned to
Hsing and told him that the grottoes on that stone
represented the years of his life; and then he took his
leave, firmly refusing to remain any longer, and not disclosing
his name.</p>

<p>More than a year after this, Hsing had occasion to go
away on business, and in the night a thief broke in
and carried off the stone, taking nothing else at all.
When Hsing came home, he was dreadfully grieved,
as if his whole object in life was gone; and made all
possible inquiries and efforts to get it back, but without
the slightest result. Some time passed away, when
one day going into a temple Hsing noticed a man
selling stones, and amongst the rest he saw his old
friend. Of course he immediately wanted to regain
possession of it; but as the stone-seller would not
<span class="pagenum" title="i-310"><a id="Page_i-310"></a></span>
consent, he shouldered the stone and went off to the
nearest mandarin. The stone-seller was then asked
what proof he could give that the stone was his; and
he replied that the number of grottoes was eighty-nine.
Hsing inquired if that was all he had to say, and when
the other acknowledged that it was, he himself told
the magistrate what were the characters inscribed within,
also calling attention to the finger marks at the closed-up
grottoes. He therefore gained his case, and the mandarin
would have bambooed the stone-seller, had he not
declared that he bought it in the market for twenty
ounces of silver,&mdash;whereupon he was dismissed.</p>

<p>A high official next offered Hsing one hundred ounces
of silver for it; but he refused to sell it even for ten
thousand, which so enraged the would-be purchaser that
he worked up a case against Hsing,<a id="Anchor-243" title="Go to Footnote 243" href="#Footnote-243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and got him put in
prison. Hsing was thereby compelled to pawn a great
deal of his property; and then the official sent some one
to try if the affair could not be managed through his
son, to which Hsing, on hearing of the attempt, steadily
refused to consent, saying that he and the stone could
not be parted even in death. His wife, however, and
his son, laid their heads together, and sent the stone
to the high official, and Hsing only heard of it when
he arrived home from the prison. He cursed his wife and
beat his son, and frequently tried to make away with
<span class="pagenum" title="i-311"><a id="Page_i-311"></a></span>
himself, though luckily his servants always managed to
prevent him from succeeding.<a id="Anchor-244" title="Go to Footnote 244" href="#Footnote-244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> At night he dreamt that a
noble-looking personage appeared to him, and said, “My
name is Shih Ch‘ing-hsü&mdash;(Stone from Heaven). Do
not grieve. I purposely quitted you for a year and more;
but next year on the 20th of the eighth moon, at dawn,
come to the Hai-tai Gate and buy me back for two
strings of cash.” Hsing was overjoyed at this dream,
and carefully took down the day mentioned. Meanwhile
the stone was at the official’s private house; but
as the cloud manifestations ceased, the stone was less
and less prized; and the following year when the official
was disgraced for maladministration and subsequently
died, Hsing met some of his servants at the Hai-tai
Gate going off to sell the stone, and purchased it back
from them for two strings of cash.</p>

<p>Hsing lived till he was eighty-nine; and then having
prepared the necessaries for his interment, bade his
son bury the stone with him,<a id="Anchor-245" title="Go to Footnote 245" href="#Footnote-245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> which was accordingly
<span class="pagenum" title="i-312"><a id="Page_i-312"></a></span>
done. Six months later robbers broke into the vault<a id="Anchor-246" title="Go to Footnote 246" href="#Footnote-246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
and made off with the stone, and his son tried in vain
to secure their capture; however, a few days afterwards,
he was travelling with his servants, when suddenly two
men rushed forth dripping with perspiration, and looking
up into the air, acknowledged their crime, saying, “Mr.
Hsing, please don’t torment us thus! We took the
stone, and sold it for only four ounces of silver.”
Hsing’s son and his servants then seized these men,
and took them before the magistrate, where they at once
acknowledged their guilt. Asking what had become
of the stone, they said they had sold it to a member
of the magistrate’s family; and when it was produced,
that official took such a fancy to it that he gave it to one
of his servants and bade him place it in the treasury.
Thereupon the stone slipped out of the servant’s hand
and broke into a hundred pieces, to the great astonishment
of all present. The magistrate now had the
thieves bambooed and sent them away; but Hsing’s
son picked up the broken pieces of the stone, and buried
them in his father’s grave.</p>

<br/>
THE QUARRELSOME BROTHERS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> K‘un-yang there lived a wealthy man named
Tsêng. When he died, and before he was put in the
coffin, tears were seen to gush forth from both eyes of
the corpse, to the infinite amazement of his six sons.
His second son, T‘i, otherwise called Yu-yü, who had
gained for himself the reputation of being a scholar, said
it was a bad omen, and warned his brothers to be careful
and not give cause for sorrow to the dead,&mdash;at which the
others only laughed at him as an idiot.</p>

<p>Tsêng’s first wife and eldest son having been carried
off by the rebels when the latter was only seven or eight
years old, he married a second wife, by whom he had
three sons, Hsiao, Chung, and Hsin; besides three other
sons by a concubine&mdash;namely, the above-mentioned T‘i,
or Yu-yü, Jen, and Yi. Now the three by the second
wife banded themselves together against the three by the
concubine, saying that the latter were a base-born lot;
and whenever a guest was present and either of them
happened to be in the room, Hsiao and his two brothers
would not take the slightest notice of them. This enraged
<span class="pagenum" title="i-314"><a id="Page_i-314"></a></span>
Jen and Yi very much, and they went to consult
with Yu-yü as to how they should avenge themselves for
such slights. Yu-yü, however, tried every means in his
power to pacify them, and would not take part in any
plot; and, as they were much younger than he, they took
his advice,<a id="Anchor-247" title="Go to Footnote 247" href="#Footnote-247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and did nothing.</p>

<p>Hsiao had a daughter, who died shortly after her marriage
to a Mr. Chou; and her father begged Yu-yü and his other
brothers to go with him and give his late daughter’s mother-in-law
a sound beating.<a id="Anchor-248" title="Go to Footnote 248" href="#Footnote-248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Yu-yü would not hear of it for a
moment; so Hsiao in a rage got his brothers Chung and
Hsin, with a lot of rowdies from the neighbourhood, and
went off and did it themselves, scattering the goods and
chattels of the family about, and smashing everything
they could lay their hands on. An action was immediately
brought by the Chou family, and Hsiao and his
two brothers were thrown into prison by the angry
mandarin, who purposed sending the case before a
<span class="pagenum" title="i-315"><a id="Page_i-315"></a></span>
higher tribunal. Yu-yü, however, whose high character
was well known to that official, interceded for them, and
himself went to the Chou family and tendered the most
humble apologies for what had occurred. The Chou
family, out of respect for Yu-yü, suffered the case to
drop, and Hsiao regained his liberty, though he did not
evince the slightest gratitude for his brother’s exertions.
Shortly after, Yu-yü’s mother died; but Hsiao and the
other two refused to put on mourning for her, going on
with their usual feasting and drinking as if nothing had
happened. Jen and Yi were furious at this; but Yu-yü
only observed, “What they do is their own indecorous
behaviour; it does not injure us.” Then, again, when
the funeral was about to take place, Hsiao, Chung, and
Hsin stood before the door of the vault, and would not
allow the others to bury their mother there. So Yu-yü
buried her alongside the principal grave. Before long
Hsiao’s wife died, and Yu-yü told Jen and Yi to accompany
him to the house and condole with the widower; to
which they both objected, saying, “He would not wear
mourning for our mother; shall we do so for his wife?”<a id="Anchor-249" title="Go to Footnote 249" href="#Footnote-249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
Ultimately Yu-yü had to go alone; and while he was
pouring forth his lamentations beside the bier, he heard
Jen and Yi playing drums and trumpets outside the
door. Hsiao flew into a tremendous passion, and went
after them with his own two brothers to give them a good
<span class="pagenum" title="i-316"><a id="Page_i-316"></a></span>
thrashing. Yu-yü, too, seized a big stick and accompanied
them to the house where Jen and Yi were;
whereupon Jen made his escape; but as Yi was clambering
over the wall, Yu-yü hit him from behind and
knocked him down. Hsiao and the others then set upon
him with their fists and sticks, and would never have
stopped but that Yu-yü interposed his body between
them and made them desist. Hsiao was very angry at
this, and began to abuse Yu-yü, who said, “The punishment
was for want of decorum, for which death would be
too severe. I can neither connive at their bad behaviour,
nor at your cruelty. If your anger is not appeased,
strike me.” Hsiao now turned his fury against Yu-yü,
and being well seconded by his two brothers, they beat
Yu-yü until the neighbours separated them and put an
end to the row. Yu-yü at once proceeded to Hsiao’s
house to apologize for what had occurred; but Hsiao
drove him away, and would not let him take part in the
funeral ceremonies. Meanwhile, as Yi’s wounds were
very severe, and he could neither eat nor drink, his
brother Jen went on his behalf to the magistrate,
stating in the petition that the accused had not worn
mourning for their father’s concubine. The magistrate
issued a warrant; and, besides causing the arrest of
Hsiao, Chung, and Hsin, he ordered Yu-yü to prosecute
them as well. Yu-yü, however, was so much cut about
the head and face that he could not appear in court, but
he wrote out a petition, in which he begged that the case
might be quashed; and this the magistrate consented
to do. Yi soon got better, the feeling of hatred and resentment
<span class="pagenum" title="i-317"><a id="Page_i-317"></a></span>
increasing in the family day by day; while Jen
and Yi, who were younger than the others, complained
to Yu-yü of their recent punishment, saying, “The
relationship of elder and younger brothers exists for
others, why not for us?” “Ah,” replied Yu-yü, “that is
what I might well say; not you.” Yu-yü then tried to
persuade them to forget the past; but, not succeeding in
his attempt, he shut up his house, and went off with his
wife to live somewhere else, about twenty miles away.
Now, although when Yu-yü was among them he did not
help the two younger ones, yet his presence acted as
some restraint upon Hsiao and the other two; but now
that he was gone their conduct was beyond all bounds.
They sought out Jen and Yi in their own houses, and not
only reviled them, but abused the memory of their dead
mother, against which Jen and Yi could only retaliate by
keeping the door shut against them. However, they determined
to do them some injury, and carried knives
about with them wherever they went for that purpose.</p>

<p>One day the eldest brother, Ch‘êng, who had been
carried off by the rebels, returned with his wife; and,
after three days’ deliberation, Hsiao and the other two
determined that, as he had been so long separated from
the family, he had no further claims upon them for
house-room, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Jen and Yi were secretly delighted at
this result, and at once inviting Ch‘êng to stay with
them, sent news of his arrival to Yu-yü, who came back
directly, and agreed with the others to hand over a share
of the property to their elder brother. Hsiao and his
clique were much enraged at this purchase of Ch‘êng’s
<span class="pagenum" title="i-318"><a id="Page_i-318"></a></span>
good will, and, hurrying to their brothers’ houses,
assailed them with every possible kind of abuse.
Ch‘êng, who had long been accustomed to scenes of
violence among the rebels, now got into a great passion,
and cried out, “When I came home none of you would
give me a place to live in. Only these younger ones
recognised the ties of blood,<a id="Anchor-250" title="Go to Footnote 250" href="#Footnote-250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> and you would punish
them for so doing. Do you think to drive me away?”
Thereupon he threw a stone at Hsiao and knocked him
down; and Jen and Yi rushed out with clubs and gave
the three of them a severe thrashing. Ch‘êng did not
wait for them to lay a plaint, but set off to the magistrate
on the spot, and preferred a charge against his
three brothers. The magistrate, as before, sent for
Yu-yü to ask his opinion, and Yu-yü had no alternative
but to go, entering the yamên with downcast head, his
tears flowing in silence all the while. The magistrate
inquired of him how the matter stood; to which he replied
only by begging His Honour to hear the case;
which the magistrate accordingly did, deciding that the
whole of the property was to be divided equally among
the seven brothers. Thenceforth Jen and Yi became
more and more attached to Ch‘êng; and one day, in
conversation, they happened to tell him the story of their
mother’s funeral. Ch‘êng was exceedingly angry, and
declared that such behaviour was that of brute beasts,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-319"><a id="Page_i-319"></a></span>
proposing at the same time that the vault should be
opened and that she should be re-buried in the proper
place. Jen and Yi went off and told this to Yu-yü, who
immediately came and begged Ch‘êng to desist from his
scheme; to which, however, he paid no attention, and
fixed a day for her interment in the family vault. He
then built a hut near by, and, with a knife lopping the
branches off the trees, informed the brothers that any of
them who did not appear at the funeral in the usual
mourning would be treated by him in a manner similar
to the trees. So they were all obliged to go, and the
obsequies were conducted in a fitting manner. The
brothers were now at peace together, Ch‘êng keeping
them in first-rate order, and always treating Hsiao,
Chung, and Hsin with much more severity than the
others. To Yu-yü he shewed a marked deference, and,
whenever he was in a rage, would always be appeased by
a word from him. Hsiao, too, was always going to
Yu-yü to complain of the treatment he received at
Ch‘êng’s hands when he did anything that Ch‘êng disapproved
of; and then, if Yu-yü quietly reproved him,
he would be dissatisfied, so that at last Yu-yü could
stand it no longer, and again went away and took a
house at a considerable distance, where he remained
almost entirely cut off from the others. By the time
two years had passed away Ch‘êng had completely succeeded
in establishing harmony amongst them, and
quarrels were of rare occurrence. Hsiao was then forty-six
years old, and had five sons; Chi-yeh and Chi-tê, the
first and third, by his wife; Chi-kung and Chi-chi, the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-320"><a id="Page_i-320"></a></span>
second and fourth, by a concubine; and Chi-tsu, by a
slave. They were all grown up, and exactly imitated
their father’s former behaviour, banding themselves together
one against the other, and so on, without their
father being able to make them behave better. Chi-tsu
had no brothers of his own, and, being the youngest, the
others bullied him dreadfully; until at length, being on a
visit to his wife’s family, who lived not far from Yu-yü’s
house, he went slightly out of his way to call and see his
uncle. There he found his three cousins living peaceably
together and pursuing their studies, and was so
pleased that he remained with them some time, and said
not a word as to returning home. His uncle urged him
to go back, but he entreated to be allowed to stay; and
then his uncle told him it was not that he grudged his
daily food: it was because his father and mother did not
know where he was. Chi-tsu accordingly went home,
and a few months afterwards, when he and his wife were
on the point of starting to congratulate his wife’s mother
on the anniversary of her birthday, he explained to his
father that he should not come home again. When his
father asked him why not, he partly divulged his reasons
for going; whereupon his father said he was afraid his
uncle would bear malice for what happened in the past,
and that he would not be able to remain there long.
“Father,” replied Chi-tsu, “uncle Yu-yü is a good and
virtuous man.” He set out with his wife, and when they
arrived Yu-yü gave them separate quarters, and made
Chi-tsu rank as one of his own sons, making him join
the eldest, Chi-san, in his studies. Chi-tsu was a clever
<span class="pagenum" title="i-321"><a id="Page_i-321"></a></span>
fellow, and now enrolled himself as a resident of the
place where his uncle lived.<a id="Anchor-251" title="Go to Footnote 251" href="#Footnote-251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, his brothers went on quarrelling among
themselves as usual; and one day Chi-kung, enraged at
an insult offered to his mother, killed Chi-yeh. He was
immediately thrown into prison, where he was severely
bambooed, and in a few days he died. Chi-yeh’s wife,
whose maiden name was Fêng, now spent the days of
mourning in cursing her husband’s murderer; and when
Chi-kung’s wife heard this, she flew into a towering
passion, and said to her, “If your husband is dead, mine
isn’t alive.” She then drew a knife and killed her, completing
the tragedy by herself committing suicide in a
well.</p>

<p>Mr. Fêng, the father of the murdered woman, was
very much distressed at his daughter’s untimely end;
and, taking with him several members of the family
with arms concealed under their clothes, they proceeded
to Hsiao’s house, and there gave his wife a
most terrific beating. It was now Ch‘êng’s turn to be
angry. “The members of my family are dying like
sheep,” cried he; “what do you mean by this, Mr.
Fêng?” He then rushed out upon them with a roar,
accompanied by all his own brothers and their sons; and
the Fêng family was utterly routed. Seizing old Fêng
himself, Ch‘êng cut off both his ears; and when his son
<span class="pagenum" title="i-322"><a id="Page_i-322"></a></span>
tried to rescue him, Chi-chi ran up and broke both his
legs with an iron crowbar. Every one of the Fêng
family was badly wounded, and thus dispersed, leaving old
Fêng’s son lying in the middle of the road. The others
not knowing what to do with him, Ch‘êng took him
under his arm, and, having thrown him down in the
Fêng village, returned home, giving orders to Chi-chi to
go immediately to the authorities and enter their plaint
the first.<a id="Anchor-252" title="Go to Footnote 252" href="#Footnote-252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>The Fêng family had, however, anticipated them,
and all the Tsêngs were accordingly thrown into
prison, except Chung, who managed to escape. He ran
away to the place where Yu-yü lived, and was pacing
backwards and forwards before the door, afraid lest his
brother should not have forgiven past offences, when suddenly
Yu-yü, with his son and nephew, arrived, on their
return from the examination. “What do you want, my
brother?” asked Yu-yü; whereupon Chung prostrated
himself at the roadside, and then Yu-yü, seizing his
hand, led him within to make further inquiries.
“Alas! alas!” cried Yu-yü, when he had heard the
story, “I knew that some dreadful calamity would be
the result of all this wicked behaviour. But why have
you come hither? I have been absent so long that I am
no more acquainted with the local authorities; and if I
now went to ask a favour of them, I should probably
only be insulted for my pains. However, if none of the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-323"><a id="Page_i-323"></a></span>
Fêng family die of their wounds, and if we three may
chance to be successful in our examination, something
may perhaps be done to mitigate this calamity.”<a id="Anchor-253" title="Go to Footnote 253" href="#Footnote-253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Yu-yü
then kept Chung to dinner, and at night he shared their
room, which kind treatment made him at once grateful
and repentant. By the end of ten days he was so struck
with the behaviour of the father, sons, uncle, nephew,
and cousins, one toward the other, that he burst into
tears, and said, “Now I know how badly I behaved in
days gone by.” His uncle was overjoyed at his repentance,
and sympathised with his feelings, when suddenly
it was announced that Yu-yü and his son had both
passed the examination for master’s degree, and that
Chi-tsu was <i xml:lang="fr">proximé accessit</i>. This delighted them all
very much. They did not, however, attend the Fu-t‘ai’s
congratulatory feast,<a id="Anchor-254" title="Go to Footnote 254" href="#Footnote-254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> but went off first to worship at the
tombs of their ancestors.</p>

<p>Now, at the time of the Ming dynasty a man who had
taken his master’s degree was a very considerable personage,<a id="Anchor-255" title="Go to Footnote 255" href="#Footnote-255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
and the Fêngs accordingly began to draw in their
<span class="pagenum" title="i-324"><a id="Page_i-324"></a></span>
horns. Yu-yü, too, met them half-way. He got a friend
to convey to them presents of food and money to help
them in recovering from their injuries, and thus the
prosecution was withdrawn. Then all his brothers implored
him with tears in their eyes to return home, and,
after burning incense with them,<a id="Anchor-256" title="Go to Footnote 256" href="#Footnote-256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> and making them
enter into a bond with him that by-gones should be
by-gones, he acceded to their request. Chi-tsu, however,
would not leave his uncle; and Hsiao himself said
to Yu-yü, “I don’t deserve such a son as that. Keep
him, and teach him as you have done hitherto, and let
him be as one of your own children; but if at some
future time he succeeds in his examination, then I will
beg you to return him to me.” Yu-yü consented to
this; and three years afterwards Chi-tsu did take his
master’s degree, upon which he sent him back to his
own family.</p>

<p>Both husband and wife were very loth to leave
their uncle’s house, and they had hardly been at
home three days before one of their children, only three
years old, ran away and went back, returning to his
great-uncle’s as often as he was recaptured. This induced
Hsiao to remove to the next house to Yu-yü’s,
and, by opening a door between the two, they made one
<span class="pagenum" title="i-325"><a id="Page_i-325"></a></span>
establishment of the whole. Ch‘êng was now getting
old, and the family affairs devolved entirely upon Yu-yü,
who managed things so well that their reputation for
filial piety and fraternal love was soon spread far and
wide.</p>

<br/>
THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO
COULDN’T SPELL.</a><a id="Anchor-257" title="Go to Footnote 257" href="#Footnote-257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Chia-p‘ing there lived a certain young gentleman
of considerable talent and very prepossessing appearance.
When seventeen years of age he went up for his
bachelor’s degree; and as he was passing the door of
a house, he saw within a pretty-looking girl, who not
only riveted his gaze, but also smiled and nodded her
head at him. Quite pleased at this, he approached the
young lady and began to talk, she, meanwhile, inquiring
of him where he lived, and if alone or otherwise. He
assured her he was quite by himself; and then she said,
“Well, I will come and see you, but you mustn’t let
any one know.” The young gentleman agreed, and
when he got home he sent all the servants to another
part of the house, and by-and-by the young lady arrived.
<span class="pagenum" title="i-327"><a id="Page_i-327"></a></span>
She said her name was Wên-chi, and that her admiration
for her host’s noble bearing had made her visit him,
unknown to her mistress. “And gladly,” added she,
“would I be your handmaid for life.” Our hero was
delighted, and proposed to purchase her from the mistress
she mentioned; and from this time she was in the habit
of coming in every other day or so. On one occasion it
was raining hard, and, after hanging up her wet cloak
upon a peg, she took off her shoes, and bade the young
gentleman clean them for her. He noticed that they
were newly embroidered with all the colours of the rainbow,
but utterly spoilt by the soaking rain; and was
just saying what a pity it was, when the young lady cried
out, “I should never have asked you to do such menial
work except to show my love for you.” All this time
the rain was falling fast outside, and Wên-chi now repeated
the following <span class="nowrap">line:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse_i0">“A nipping wind and chilly rain fill the river and the city.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“There,” said she, “cap that.” The young gentleman
replied that he could not, as he did not even
understand what it meant. “Oh, really,” retorted the
young lady, “if you’re not more of a scholar than that,
I shall begin to think very little of you.” She then told
him he had better practice making verses, and he
promised he would do so.</p>

<p>By degrees Miss Wên-chi’s frequent visits attracted
the notice of the servants, as also of a brother-in-law
named Sung, who was likewise a gentleman of position;
<span class="pagenum" title="i-328"><a id="Page_i-328"></a></span>
and the latter begged our hero to be allowed to have
a peep at her. He was told in reply that the young
lady had strictly forbidden that any one should see her;
however, he concealed himself in the servants’ quarters,
and when she arrived he looked at her through the
window. Almost beside himself, he now opened the
door; whereupon Wên-chi jumping up, vaulted over the
wall and disappeared. Sung was really smitten with
her, and went off to her mistress to try and arrange
for her purchase; but when he mentioned Wên-chi’s
name, he was informed that they had once had such
a girl, who had died several years previously. In great
amazement Sung went back and told his brother-in-law,
and he now knew that his beloved Wên-chi was a
disembodied spirit. So when she came again he asked
her if it was so; to which she replied, “It is; but as you
wanted a nice wife and I a handsome husband, I thought
we should be a suitable pair. What matters it that one
is a mortal and the other a spirit?” The young gentleman
thoroughly coincided in her view of the case; and
when his examination was over, and he was homeward
bound, Wên-chi accompanied him, invisible to others
and visible to him alone. Arriving at his parents’ house,
he installed her in the library; and the day she went
to pay the customary bride’s visit to her father and
mother,<a id="Anchor-258" title="Go to Footnote 258" href="#Footnote-258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> he told his own mother the whole story. She
and his father were greatly alarmed, and ordered him
<span class="pagenum" title="i-329"><a id="Page_i-329"></a></span>
to have no more to do with her; but he would not listen
to this, and then his parents tried by all kinds of devices
to get rid of the girl, none of which met with any
success.</p>

<p>One day our hero had left upon the table some written
instructions for one of the servants, wherein he had
made a number of mistakes in spelling, such as <i>paper</i>
for <i>pepper</i>, <i>jinjer</i> for <i>ginger</i>, and so on; and when Wên-chi
saw this, she wrote at the <span class="nowrap">foot:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse_i-0-5">“Paper for pepper do I see?</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">Jinjer for ginger can it be?</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">Of such a husband I’m afraid;</div>
  <div class="verse_i0">I’d rather be a servant-maid.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>She then said to the young gentleman, “Imagining
you to be a man of culture, I hid my blushes and
sought you out the first.<a id="Anchor-259" title="Go to Footnote 259" href="#Footnote-259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Alas, your qualifications are on
the outside; should I not thus be a laughing-stock to
all?” She then disappeared, at which the young gentleman
was much hurt; but not knowing to what she
alluded, he gave the instructions to his servant, and
so made himself the butt of all who heard the story.</p>

<br/>
THE TIGER GUEST.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A young</span> man named Kung, a native of Min-chou, on
his way to the examination at Hsi-ngan, rested awhile
in an inn, and ordered some wine to drink. Just then a
very tall and noble-looking stranger walked in, and,
seating himself by the side of Kung, entered into
conversation with him. Kung offered him a cup of
wine, which the stranger did not refuse; saying, at the
same time, that his name was Miao. But he was a
rough, coarse fellow; and Kung, therefore, when the
wine was finished, did not call for any more. Miao then
rose, and observing that Kung did not appreciate a man
of his capacity, went out into the market to buy some,
returning shortly with a huge bowl full. Kung declined
the proffered wine; but Miao, seizing his arm to persuade
him, gripped it so painfully that Kung was
forced to drink a few more cups, Miao himself swilling
away as hard as he could go out of a soup-plate. “I am
not good at entertaining people,” cried Miao, at length;
“pray go on or stop just as you please.” Kung accordingly
put together his things and went off; but he had
not gone more than a few miles when his horse was
taken ill, and lay down in the road. While he was waiting
<span class="pagenum" title="i-331"><a id="Page_i-331"></a></span>
there with all his heavy baggage, revolving in his mind
what he should do, up came Mr. Miao; who, when he
heard what was the matter, took off his coat and handed
it to the servant, and lifting up the horse, carried it off
on his back to the nearest inn, which was about six
or seven miles distant. Arriving there he put the
animal in the stable, and before long Kung and his
servants arrived too. Kung was much astonished
at Mr. Miao’s feat; and, believing him to be superhuman,
began to treat him with the utmost deference,
ordering both wine and food to be procured for their
refreshment. “My appetite,” remarked Miao, “is one
that you could not easily satisfy. Let us stick to wine.”
So they finished another stoup together, and then Miao
got up and took his leave, saying, “It will be some time
before your horse is well; I cannot wait for you.” He
then went away.</p>

<p>After the examination several friends of Kung’s invited
him to join them in a picnic to the Flowery Hill; and
just as they were all feasting and laughing together, lo!
Mr. Miao walked up. In one hand he held a large
flagon, and in the other a ham, both of which he laid
down on the ground before them. “Hearing,” said
he, “that you gentlemen were coming here, I have
tacked myself on to you, like a fly to a horse’s tail.”<a id="Anchor-260" title="Go to Footnote 260" href="#Footnote-260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
Kung and his friends then rose and received him with
<span class="pagenum" title="i-332"><a id="Page_i-332"></a></span>
the usual ceremonies, after which they all sat down
promiscuously.<a id="Anchor-261" title="Go to Footnote 261" href="#Footnote-261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> By-and-by, when the wine had gone
round pretty freely, some one proposed capping verses;
whereupon Miao cried out, “Oh, we’re very jolly
drinking like this; what’s the use of making oneself
uncomfortable?” The others, however, would not listen
to him, and agreed that as a forfeit a huge goblet of
wine should be drunk by any defaulter. “Let us rather
make death the penalty,” said Miao; to which they
replied, laughing, that such a punishment was a trifle
too severe; and then Miao retorted that if it was not
to be death, even a rough fellow like himself might
be able to join. A Mr. Chin, who was sitting at the
top of the line, then <span class="nowrap">began:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse_i0">“From the hill-top high, wide extends the gaze&mdash;”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">upon which Miao immediately carried on with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="verse_i2">“Redly gleams the sword o’er the shattered vase.”<a id="Anchor-262" title="Go to Footnote 262" href="#Footnote-262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="pagenum" title="i-333"><a id="Page_i-333"></a></span>
The next gentleman thought for a long time, during
which Miao was helping himself to wine; and by-and-by
they had all capped the verse, but so wretchedly that
Miao called out, “Oh, come! if we aren’t to be fined
for these,<a id="Anchor-263" title="Go to Footnote 263" href="#Footnote-263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> we had better abstain from making any more.”
As none of them would agree to this, Miao could stand
it no longer, and roared like a dragon till the hills and
valleys echoed again. He then went down on his hands
and knees, and jumped about like a lion, which utterly
confused the poets, and put an end to their lucubrations.
The wine had now been round a good many times, and
being half tipsy each began to repeat to the other the
verses he had handed in at the recent examination,<a id="Anchor-264" title="Go to Footnote 264" href="#Footnote-264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
all at the same time indulging in any amount of mutual
flattery. This so disgusted Miao that he drew Kung
aside to have a game at “guess-fingers;”<a id="Anchor-265" title="Go to Footnote 265" href="#Footnote-265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> but as they
<span class="pagenum" title="i-334"><a id="Page_i-334"></a></span>
went on droning away all the same, he at length cried
out, “Do stop your rubbish, fit only for your own
wives,<a id="Anchor-266" title="Go to Footnote 266" href="#Footnote-266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> and not for general company.” The others
were much abashed at this, and so angry were they
at Miao’s rudeness that they went on repeating all the
louder. Miao then threw himself on the ground in
a passion, and with a roar changed into a tiger, immediately
springing upon the company, and killing them
all except Kung and Mr. Chin. He then ran off roaring
loudly. Now this Mr. Chin succeeded in taking his
master’s degree; and three years afterwards, happening
to revisit the Flowery Hill, he beheld a Mr. Chi, one of
those very gentlemen who had previously been killed
by the tiger. In great alarm he was making off, when
Chi seized his bridle and would not let him proceed.
So he got down from his horse, and inquired what was
the matter; to which Chi replied, “I am now the slave
of Miao, and have to endure bitter toil for him. He
must kill some one else before I can be set free.<a id="Anchor-267" title="Go to Footnote 267" href="#Footnote-267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Three
<span class="pagenum" title="i-335"><a id="Page_i-335"></a></span>
days hence a man, arrayed in the robes and cap of a
scholar, should be eaten by the tiger at the foot of the
Ts‘ang-lung Hill. Do you on that day take some gentleman
thither, and thus help your old friend.” Chin was
too frightened to say much, but promising that he would
do so, rode away home. He then began to consider the
matter over with himself, and, regarding it as a plot, he
determined to break his engagement, and let his friend
remain the tiger’s devil. He chanced, however, to
repeat the story to a Mr. Chiang who was a relative of
his, and one of the local scholars; and as this gentleman
had a grudge against another scholar, named Yu,
who had come out equal with him at the examination,
he made up his mind to destroy him. So he invited Yu
to accompany him on that day to the place in question,
mentioning that he himself should appear in undress
only. Yu could not make out the reason for this; but
when he reached the spot there he found all kinds of
wine and food ready for his entertainment. Now that
very day the Prefect had come to the hill; and being
a friend of the Chiang family, and hearing that Chiang
was below, sent for him to come up. Chiang did not
dare to appear before him in undress, and borrowed Yu’s
clothes and hat; but he had no sooner got them on
than out rushed the tiger and carried him away in its
mouth.</p>

THE SISTERS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">His Excellency</span> the Grand Secretary Mao came
from an obscure family in the district of Yeh, his
father being only a poor cow-herd. At the same place
there resided a wealthy gentleman, named Chang, who
owned a burial-ground in the neighbourhood; and
some one informed him that while passing by he had
heard sounds of wrangling from within the grave, and
voices saying, “Make haste and go away; do not
disturb His Excellency’s home.” Chang did not much
believe this; but subsequently he had several dreams
in which he was told that the burial-ground in question
really belonged to the Mao family, and that he had no
right whatever to it. From this moment the affairs of
his house began to go wrong;<a id="Anchor-268" title="Go to Footnote 268" href="#Footnote-268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> and at length he listened
<span class="pagenum" title="i-337"><a id="Page_i-337"></a></span>
to the remonstrances of friends and removed his dead
elsewhere.</p>

<p>One day Mao’s father, the cow-herd, was out near
this burial-ground, when, a storm of rain coming on, he
took refuge in the now empty grave, while the rain came
down harder than ever, and by-and-by flooded the whole
place and drowned the old man. The Grand Secretary
was then a mere boy, and his mother went off to
Chang to beg a piece of ground wherein to bury her
dead husband. When Chang heard her name he was
greatly astonished; and on going to look at the spot
where the old man was drowned, found that it was
exactly at the proper place for the coffin. More than
ever amazed, he gave orders that the body should be
buried there in the old grave, and also bade Mao’s
mother bring her son to see him. When the funeral
was over, she went with Mao to Mr. Chang’s house, to
thank him for his kindness; and so pleased was he
with the boy that he kept him to be educated, ranking
him as one of his own sons. He also said he would
give him his eldest daughter as a wife, an offer which
Mao’s mother hardly dared accept; but Mrs. Chang
said that the thing was settled and couldn’t be altered,
so then she was obliged to consent. The young lady,
however, had a great contempt for Mao, and made no
effort to disguise her feelings; and if any one spoke to
her of him, she would put her fingers in her ears, declaring
she would die sooner than marry the cow-boy.
On the day appointed for the wedding, the bridegroom
arrived, and was feasted within, while outside the door a
<span class="pagenum" title="i-338"><a id="Page_i-338"></a></span>
handsome chair was in waiting to convey away the
bride, who all this time was standing crying in a corner,
wiping her eyes with her sleeve, and absolutely refusing
to dress. Just then the bridegroom sent in to say he
was going,<a id="Anchor-269" title="Go to Footnote 269" href="#Footnote-269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> and the drums and trumpets struck up the
wedding march, at which the bride’s tears only fell the
faster as her hair hung dishevelled down her back.
Her father managed to detain Mao awhile, and went in
to urge his daughter to make haste, she weeping bitterly
as if she did not hear what he was saying. He now got
into a rage, which only made her cry the louder; and in
the middle of it all a servant came to say the bridegroom
wished to take his leave. The father ran out
and said his daughter wasn’t quite ready, begging Mao
to wait a little longer; and then hurried back again to
the bride. Thus they went on for some time, backwards
and forwards, until at last things began to look
serious, for the young lady obstinately refused to yield;
and Mr. Chang was ready to commit suicide for want of
anything better. Just then his second daughter was
standing by upbraiding her elder sister for her disobedience,
when suddenly the latter turned round in a
rage, and cried out, “So you are imitating the rest of
them, you little minx; why don’t you go and marry him
yourself?” “My father did not betroth me to Mr.
<span class="pagenum" title="i-339"><a id="Page_i-339"></a></span>
Mao,” answered she, “but if he had I should not
require you to persuade me to accept him.” Her father
was delighted with this reply, and at once went off and
consulted with his wife as to whether they could venture
to substitute the second for the elder; and then her
mother came and said to her, “That bad girl there
won’t obey her parent’s commands; we wish, therefore,
to put you in her place: will you consent to this arrangement?”
The younger sister readily agreed, saying
that had they told her to marry a beggar she would not
have dared to refuse, and that she had not such a low
opinion of Mr. Mao as all that. Her father and
mother rejoiced exceedingly at receiving this reply; and
dressing her up in her sister’s clothes, put her in the
bridal chair and sent her off. She proved an excellent
wife, and lived in harmony with her husband; but she
was troubled with a disease of the hair, which caused
Mr. Mao some annoyance. Later on, she told him how
she had changed places with her sister, and this made
him think more highly of her than before. Soon after
Mao took his bachelor’s degree, and then set off to
present himself as a candidate for the master’s degree.
On the way he passed by an inn, the landlord of which
had dreamt the night before that a spirit appeared to
him and said, “To-morrow Mr. Mao, first on the list,
will come. Some day he will extricate you from a
difficulty.” Accordingly the landlord got up early, and
took especial note of all guests who came from the eastward,
until at last Mao himself arrived. The landlord
was very glad to see him, and provided him with the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-340"><a id="Page_i-340"></a></span>
best of everything, refusing to take any payment for it
all, but telling what he had dreamt the night before.
Mao now began to give himself airs; and, reflecting
that his wife’s want of hair would make him look
ridiculous, he determined that as soon as he attained
to rank and power he would find another spouse. But
alas! when the successful list of candidates was published,
Mao’s name was not among them; and he
retraced his steps with a heavy heart, and by another
road, so as to avoid meeting the innkeeper. Three years
afterwards he went up again, and the landlord received
him with precisely the same attentions as on the previous
occasion; upon which Mao said to him, “Your former
words did not come true; I am now ashamed to put
you to so much trouble.” “Ah,” replied the landlord,
“you meant to get rid of your wife, and the Ruler of
the world below struck out your name.<a id="Anchor-270" title="Go to Footnote 270" href="#Footnote-270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> My dream
couldn’t have been false.” In great astonishment, Mao
asked what he meant by these words; and then he
learnt that after his departure the landlord had had a
second dream informing him of the above facts. Mao
was much alarmed at what he heard, and remained as
motionless as a wooden image, until the landlord said
to him, “You, Sir, as a scholar, should have more self-respect,
and you will certainly take the highest place.”
<span class="pagenum" title="i-341"><a id="Page_i-341"></a></span>
By-and-by when the list came out, Mao was the first
of all; and almost simultaneously his wife’s hair began
to grow quite thick, making her much better-looking
than she had hitherto been.</p>

<p>Now her elder sister had married a rich young fellow
of good family, who lived in the neighbourhood, which
made the young lady more contemptuous than ever;
but he was so extravagant and so idle that their property
was soon gone, and they were positively in want
of food. Hearing, too, of Mr. Mao’s success at the
examination, she was overwhelmed with shame and vexation,
and avoided even meeting her sister in the street.
Just then her husband died and left her destitute; and
about the same time Mao took his doctor’s degree,
which so aggravated her feelings that, in a passion, she
became a nun. Subsequently, when Mao rose to be a
high officer of state, she sent a novice to his yamên to
try and get a subscription out of him for the temple;
and Mao’s wife, who gave several pieces of silk and
other things, secretly inserted a sum of money among
them. The novice, not knowing this, reported what she
had received to the elder sister, who cried out in a passion,
“I wanted money to buy food with; of what use are
these things to me?” So she bade the novice take
them back; and when Mao and his wife saw her return,
they suspected what had happened, and opening the
parcel found the money still there. They now understood
why the presents had been refused; and taking
the money, Mao said to the novice, “If one hundred
ounces of silver is too much luck for your mistress to
<span class="pagenum" title="i-342"><a id="Page_i-342"></a></span>
secure, of course she could never have secured a high
official, such as I am now, for her husband.” He then
took fifty ounces, and giving them to the novice, sent
her away, adding, “Hand this to your mistress, I’m
afraid more would be too much for her.”<a id="Anchor-271" title="Go to Footnote 271" href="#Footnote-271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> The novice
returned and repeated all that had been said; and then
the elder sister sighed to think what a failure her life
had been, and how she had rejected the worthy to
accept the worthless. After this, the innkeeper got into
trouble about a case of murder, and was imprisoned;
but Mao exerted his influence, and obtained the man’s
pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">The</span> Buddhist priest, T‘i-k‘ung, relates that when he
was at Ch‘ing-chou he saw two foreign priests of very
extraordinary appearance. They wore rings in their ears,
were dressed in yellow cloth, and had curly hair and
beards. They said they had come from the countries of
the west; and hearing that the Governor of the district
was a devoted follower of Buddha, they went to visit
him. The Governor sent a couple of servants to
escort them to the monastery of the place, where the
abbot, Ling-p‘ei, did not receive them very cordially;
but the secular manager, seeing that they were not
ordinary individuals, entertained them and kept them
there for the night. Some one asked if there were many
strange men in the west, and what magical arts were
practised by the Lohans;<a id="Anchor-273" title="Go to Footnote 273" href="#Footnote-273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> whereupon one of them
laughed, and putting forth his hand from his sleeve,
showed a small pagoda, fully a foot in height, and beautifully
<span class="pagenum" title="i-344"><a id="Page_i-344"></a></span>
carved, standing upon the palm. Now very high
up in the wall there was a niche; and the priest threw
the pagoda up to it, when lo! it stood there firm and
straight. After a few moments the pagoda began to incline
to one side, and a glory, as from a relic of some
saint, was diffused throughout the room. The other
priest then bared his arms, and stretched out his left
until it was five or six feet in length, at the same time
shortening his right arm until it dwindled to nothing.
He then stretched out the latter until it was as long as
his left arm.</p>

he killed his wife. The neighbours reported the murder
to the officials, and the high authorities instructed the
district magistrate to investigate the case. At this
juncture Mr. Li was standing at the door of his residence;
and snatching a butcher’s knife from a stall
hard by, he rushed into the Ch‘êng-huang<a id="Anchor-276" title="Go to Footnote 276" href="#Footnote-276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> temple,
where, mounting the theatrical stage,<a id="Anchor-277" title="Go to Footnote 277" href="#Footnote-277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> he threw himself
on his knees, and spoke as follows:&mdash;“The spirit here
will punish me. I am not to be prosecuted by evil men

spirit moves me to cut off an ear.” Thereupon he cut
<span class="pagenum" title="i-346"><a id="Page_i-346"></a></span>
off his left ear and threw it down from the stage. He
then said the spirit was going to fine him a hand for
cheating people out of their money; and he forthwith
chopped off his left hand. Lastly, he cried out that he
was to be punished severely for all his many crimes;
and immediately cut his own throat. The Viceroy
subsequently received the Imperial permission to deprive

THE MASTER THIEF.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Before</span> his rebellion,<a id="Anchor-280" title="Go to Footnote 280" href="#Footnote-280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Prince Wu frequently told his
soldiers that if any one of them could catch a tiger unaided
he would give him a handsome pension and the
title of the Tiger Daunter. In his camp there was a
man named Pao-chu, as strong and agile as a monkey;
and once when a new tower was being built, the wooden
framework having only just been set up, Pao-chu walked
along the eaves, and finally got up on to the very tip-top
beam, where he ran backwards and forwards several
times. He then jumped down, alighting safely on his
feet.</p>

<p>Now Prince Wu had a favourite concubine, who was a
skilful player on the guitar; and the nuts of the instrument
she used were of warm jade,<a id="Anchor-281" title="Go to Footnote 281" href="#Footnote-281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> so that when played
upon there was a general feeling of warmth throughout
the room. The young lady was extremely careful of this
<span class="pagenum" title="i-348"><a id="Page_i-348"></a></span>
treasure, and never produced it for any one to see unless
on receipt of the Prince’s written order. One night, in
the middle of a banquet, a guest begged to be allowed to
see this wonderful guitar; but the Prince, being in a lazy
mood, said it should be exhibited to him on the following
day. Pao-chu, who was standing by, then observed
that he could get it without troubling the Prince to write
an order. Some one was therefore sent off beforehand
to instruct all the officials to be on the watch, and then
the Prince told Pao-chu he might go; and after scaling
numerous walls the latter found himself near the lady’s
room. Lamps were burning brightly within; the doors
were bolted and barred, and it was impossible to effect
an entrance. Under the verandah, however, was a
cockatoo fast asleep on its perch; and Pao-chu first
mewing several times like a cat, followed it up by imitating
the voice of the bird, and cried out as though in distress,
“The cat! the cat!” He then heard the concubine
call to one of the slave girls, and bid her go rescue the
cockatoo which was being killed; and, hiding himself in
a dark corner, he saw a girl come forth with a light in
her hand. She had barely got outside the door when he
rushed in, and there he saw the lady sitting with the
guitar on a table before her. Seizing the instrument he
turned and fled; upon which the concubine shrieked out,
“Thieves! thieves!” And the guard, seeing a man
making off with the guitar, at once started in pursuit.
Arrows fell round Pao-chu like drops of rain, but he
climbed up one of a number of huge ash trees growing
there, and from its top leaped on to the top of the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-349"><a id="Page_i-349"></a></span>
next, and so on, until he had reached the furthermost
tree, when he jumped on to the roof of a house, and
from that to another, more as if he were flying than anything
else. In a few minutes he had disappeared, and
before long presented himself suddenly at the banquet-table
with the guitar in his hand, the entrance-gate
having been securely barred all the time, and not a dog
or a cock aroused.</p>

A FLOOD.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">In</span> the twenty-first year of K‘ang Hsi<a id="Anchor-282" title="Go to Footnote 282" href="#Footnote-282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> there was a
severe drought, not a green blade appearing in the
parched ground all through the spring and well into the
summer. On the 13th of the 6th moon a little rain fell,
and people began to plant their rice. On the 18th there
was a heavy fall, and beans were sown.</p>

<p>Now at a certain village there was an old man, who,
noticing two bullocks fighting on the hills, told the
villagers that a great flood was at hand, and forthwith
removed with his family to another part of the country.
The villagers all laughed at him; but before very long
rain began to fall in torrents, lasting all through the
night, until the water was several feet deep, and carrying
away the houses. Among the others was a man who,
neglecting to save his two children, with his wife assisted
his aged mother to reach a place of safety, from which
they looked down at their old home, now only an
<span class="pagenum" title="i-351"><a id="Page_i-351"></a></span>
expanse of water, without hope of ever seeing the
children again. When the flood had subsided, they
went back, to find the whole place a complete ruin;
but in their own house they discovered the two boys
playing and laughing on the bed as if nothing had
happened. Some one remarked that this was a reward
for the filial piety of the parents. It happened on the
20th of the 6th moon.<a id="Anchor-283" title="Go to Footnote 283" href="#Footnote-283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

told me that in his village there was a certain man who
had been killed by the rebels when they passed through
the place. The man’s head was left hanging down on
his chest; and as soon as the rebels had gone, his
servants secured the body and were about to bury it.
Hearing, however, a sound of breathing, they looked
more closely, and found that the windpipe was not
wholly severed; and, setting his head in its proper place,
they carried him back home. In twenty-four hours he
began to moan; and by dint of carefully feeding him
with a spoon, within six months he had quite recovered.</p>

<p>Some ten years afterwards he was chatting with a few
friends, when one of them made a joke which called
forth loud applause from the others. Our hero, too,
clapped his hands; but, as he was bending backwards

open, and down fell his head with a gush of blood.

THE RAT WIFE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Hsi Shan</span> was a native of Kao-mi, and a trader by
occupation. He frequently slept at a place called
Mêng-i. One day he was delayed on the road by rain,
and when he arrived at his usual quarters it was already
late in the night. He knocked at all the doors, but no
one answered; and he was walking backwards and forwards
in the piazza when suddenly a door flew open and
an old man came out. He invited the traveller to
enter, an invitation to which Hsi Shan gladly responded;
and, tying up his mule, he went in. The place was
totally unfurnished; and the old man began by saying that
it was only out of compassion that he had asked him in,
as his house was not an inn. “There are only three or
four of us,” added he; “and my wife and daughter are
fast asleep. We have some of yesterday’s food, which I
will get ready for you; you must not object to its being
cold.” He then went within, and shortly afterwards returned
with a low couch, which he placed on the ground,
begging his guest to be seated, at the same time hurrying
back for a low table, and soon for a number of other
things, until at last Hsi Shan was quite uncomfortable,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-356"><a id="Page_i-356"></a></span>
and entreated his host to rest himself awhile. By-and-by
a young lady came out, bringing some wine; upon which
the old man said, “Oh, our A-ch‘ien has got up.” She
was about sixteen or seventeen, a slender and pretty-looking
girl; and as Hsi Shan had an unmarried brother,
he began to think directly that she would do for him.
So he inquired of the old man his name and address, to
which the latter replied that his name was Ku, and that
his children had all died save this one daughter. “I
didn’t like to wake her just now, but I suppose my wife
told her to get up.” Hsi Shan then asked the name of
his son-in-law, and was informed that the young lady was
not yet engaged,&mdash;at which he was secretly very much
pleased. A tray of food was now brought in, evidently
the remains from the day before; and when he had
finished eating, Hsi Shan began respectfully to address
the old man as follows:&mdash;“I am only a poor wayfarer,
but I shall never forget the kindness with which you
have treated me. Let me presume upon it, and submit
to your consideration a plan I have in my head. My
younger brother, San-lang, is seventeen years old. He
is a student, and by no means unsteady or dull. May I
hope that you will unite our families together, and not
think it presumption on my part?” “I, too, am but a
temporary sojourner,” replied the old man, rejoicing;
“and if you will only let me have a part of your house,
I shall be very glad to come and live with you.” Hsi
Shan consented to this, and got up and thanked him for
the promise of his daughter; upon which the old man
set to work to make him comfortable for the night, and
<span class="pagenum" title="i-357"><a id="Page_i-357"></a></span>
then went away. At cock-crow he was outside, calling
his guest to come and have a wash; and when Hsi Shan
had packed up ready to go, he offered to pay for his
night’s entertainment. This, however, the old man refused,
saying, “I could hardly charge a stranger anything
for a single meal; how much less could I take money
from my intended son-in-law?” They then separated,
and in about a month Hsi Shan returned; but when he
was a short distance from the village he met an old
woman with a young lady, both dressed in deep mourning.
As they approached he began to suspect it was
A-ch‘ien; and the young lady, after turning round to
look at him, pulled the old woman’s sleeve, and whispered
something in her ear, which Hsi Shan himself did
not hear. The old woman stopped immediately, and
asked if she was addressing Mr. Hsi; and when informed
that she was, she said mournfully, “Alas! my
husband has been killed by the falling of a wall. We
are going to bury him to-day. There is no one at home;
but please wait here, and we will be back by-and-by.”
They then disappeared among the trees; and, returning
after a short absence, they walked along together in the
dusk of the evening. The old woman complained
bitterly of their lonely and helpless state, and Hsi
Shan himself was moved to compassion by the sight of
her tears. She told him that the people of the neighbourhood
were a bad lot, and that if he thought of
marrying the poor widow’s daughter, he had better lose
no time in doing so. Hsi Shan said he was willing; and
when they reached the house the old woman, after lighting
<span class="pagenum" title="i-358"><a id="Page_i-358"></a></span>
the lamp and setting food before him, proceeded to
speak as follows:&mdash;“Knowing, Sir, that you would
shortly arrive, we sold all our grain except about twenty
piculs. We cannot take this with us so far; but a mile
or so to the north of the village, at the first house you
come to, there lives a man named T‘an Erh-ch‘üan, who
often buys grain from me. Don’t think it too much
trouble to oblige me by taking a sack with you on your
mule and proceeding thither at once. Tell Mr. T‘an
that the old lady of the southern village has several
piculs of grain which she wishes to sell in order to get
money for a journey, and beg him to send some animals
to carry it.” The old woman then gave him a sack of
grain; and Hsi Shan, whipping up his mule, was soon at
the place; and, knocking at the door, a great fat fellow
came out, to whom he told his errand. Emptying the
sack he had brought, he went back himself first; and
before long a couple of men arrived leading five mules.
The old woman took them into the granary, which was a
cellar below ground, and Hsi Shan, going down himself,
handed up the bags to the mother and daughter, who
passed them on from one to the other. In a little while
the men had got a load, with which they went off, returning
altogether four times before all the grain was
exhausted. They then paid the old woman, who kept
one man and two mules, and, packing up her things, set
off towards the east. After travelling some seven miles
day began to break; and by-and-by they reached a
market town, where the old woman hired animals and
sent back T‘an’s servant. When they arrived at Hsi
<span class="pagenum" title="i-359"><a id="Page_i-359"></a></span>
Shan’s home he related the whole story to his parents,
who were very pleased at what had happened, and provided
separate apartments for the old lady, at the same
time engaging a fortune-teller to fix on a lucky day for
A-ch‘ien’s marriage with their son San-lang. The old
woman prepared a handsome trousseau; and as for
A-ch‘ien herself, she spoke but little, seldom losing her
temper, and if any one addressed her she would only
reply with a smile. She employed all her time in spinning,
and thus became a general favourite with all alike.
“Tell your brother,” said she to San-lang, “that when
he happens to pass our old residence he will do well not
to make any mention of my mother and myself.”</p>

<p>In three or four years’ time the Hsi family had made
plenty of money, and San-lang had taken his bachelor’s
degree, when one day Hsi Shan happened to pass a
night with the people who lived next door to the house
where he had met A-ch‘ien. After telling them the
story of his having had nowhere to sleep, and taking
refuge with the old man and woman, his host said to
him, “You must make a mistake, Sir; the house you
allude to belongs to my uncle, but was abandoned three
years ago in consequence of its being haunted. It has
now been uninhabited for a long time. What old man
and woman can have entertained you there?” Hsi Shan
was very much astonished at this, but did not put much
faith in what he heard; meanwhile his host continued,
“For ten years no one dared enter the house; however,
one day the back wall fell down, and my uncle, going to
look at it, found, half-buried underneath the ruins, a large
<span class="pagenum" title="i-360"><a id="Page_i-360"></a></span>
rat, almost as big as a cat. It was still moving, and my
uncle went off to call for assistance, but when he got
back the rat had disappeared. Everyone suspected some
supernatural agency to be at work, though on returning
to the spot ten days afterwards nothing was to be either
heard or seen; and about a year subsequently the place
was inhabited once more.” Hsi Shan was more than
ever amazed at what he now heard, and on reaching
home told the family what had occurred; for he feared
that his brother’s wife was not a human being, and became
rather anxious about him. San-lang himself
continued to be much attached to A-ch‘ien; but by-and-by
the other members of the family let A-ch‘ien
perceive that they had suspicions about her. So one
night she complained to San-lang, saying, “I have been
a good wife to you for some years: now I have become
an object of contempt. I pray you give me my divorce,<a id="Anchor-288" title="Go to Footnote 288" href="#Footnote-288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
and seek for yourself some worthier mate.” She then burst
into a flood of tears; whereupon San-lang said, “You
should know my feelings by this time. Ever since you
<span class="pagenum" title="i-361"><a id="Page_i-361"></a></span>
entered the house the family has prospered; and that
prosperity is entirely due to you. Who can say it is not
so?” “I know full well,” replied A-ch‘ien, “what you
feel; still there are the others, and I do not wish to
share the fate of an autumn fan.”<a id="Anchor-289" title="Go to Footnote 289" href="#Footnote-289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> At length San-lang
succeeded in pacifying her; but Hsi Shan could not
dismiss the subject from his thoughts, and gave out that
he was going to get a first-rate mouser, with a view to
testing A-ch‘ien. She did not seem very frightened at
this, though evidently ill at ease; and one night she told
San-lang that her mother was not very well, and that he
needn’t come to bid her good night as usual. In the
morning mother and daughter had disappeared; at which
San-lang was greatly alarmed, and sent out to look for
them in every direction. No traces of the fugitives could
be discovered, and San-lang was overwhelmed with grief,
unable either to eat or to sleep. His father and brother
thought it was a lucky thing for him, and advised him to
<span class="pagenum" title="i-362"><a id="Page_i-362"></a></span>
console himself with another wife. This, however, he
refused to do; until, about a year afterwards, nothing
more having been heard of A-ch‘ien, he could not resist
their importunities any longer, and bought himself a
concubine. But he never ceased to think of A-ch‘ien;
and some years later, when the prosperity of the family
was on the wane, they all began to regret her loss.</p>

<p>Now San-lang had a step-brother, named Lan, who,
when travelling to Chiao-chou on business, passed a
night at the house of a relative named Lu. He noticed
that during the night sounds of weeping and lamentation
proceeded from their next-door neighbours, but he did
not inquire the reason of it; however, on his way back
he heard the same sounds, and then asked what was the
cause of such demonstrations. Mr. Lu told him that a
few years ago an old widow and her daughter had come
there to live, and that the mother had died about a
month previously, leaving her child quite alone in the
world. Lan inquired what her name was, and Mr. Lu
said it was Ku; “But,” added he, “the door is closely
barred, and as they never had any communication with
the village, I know nothing of their antecedents.” “It’s
my sister-in-law,” cried Lan, in amazement, and at once
proceeded to knock at the door of the house. Some
one came to the front door, and said, in a voice that
betokened recent weeping, “Who’s there? There
are no men in this house.”<a id="Anchor-290" title="Go to Footnote 290" href="#Footnote-290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Lan looked through a
<span class="pagenum" title="i-363"><a id="Page_i-363"></a></span>
crack, and saw that the young lady really was his sister-in-law;
so he called out, “Sister, open the door. I am
your step-brother A-sui.” A-ch‘ien immediately opened
the door and asked him in, and recounted to him the
whole story of her troubles. “Your husband,” said Lan,
“is always thinking of you. For a trifling difference
you need hardly have run away so far from him.” He
then proposed to hire a vehicle and take her home; but
A-ch‘ien replied, “I came hither with my mother to
hide because I was held in contempt, and should make
myself ridiculous by now returning thus. If I am to go
back, my elder brother Hsi Shan must no longer live
with us; otherwise, I will assuredly poison myself.”
Lan then went home and told San-lang, who set off and
travelled all night until he reached the place where
A-ch‘ien was. Husband and wife were overjoyed to
meet again, and the following day San-lang notified the
landlord of the house where A-ch‘ien had been living.
Now this landlord had long desired to secure A-ch‘ien
as a concubine for himself; and, after making no claim
for rent for several years, he began to hint as much to
her mother. The old lady, however, refused flatly;
but shortly afterwards she died, and then the landlord
thought that he might be able to succeed. At this
juncture San-lang arrived, and the landlord sought to
hamper him by putting in his claim for rent; and, as
San-lang was anything but well off at the moment, it
really did annoy him very much. A-ch‘ien here came to
the rescue, showing San-lang a large quantity of grain
she had in the house, and bidding him use it to settle
<span class="pagenum" title="i-364"><a id="Page_i-364"></a></span>
accounts with the landlord. The latter declared he
could not accept grain, but must be paid in silver;
whereupon A-ch‘ien sighed and said it was all her unfortunate
self that had brought this upon them, at the
same time telling San-lang of the landlord’s former proposition.
San-lang was very angry, and was about to
take out a summons against him, when Mr. Lu interposed,
and, by selling the grain in the neighbourhood,
managed to collect sufficient money to pay off the rent.
San-lang and his wife then returned home; and the
former, having explained the circumstances to his parents,
separated his household from that of his brother.
A-ch‘ien now proceeded to build, with her own money,
a granary, which was a matter of some astonishment to
the family, there not being a hundredweight of grain in
the place. But in about a year the granary was full,<a id="Anchor-291" title="Go to Footnote 291" href="#Footnote-291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
and before very long San-lang was a rich man, Hsi Shan
remaining as poor as before. Accordingly, A-ch‘ien persuaded
her husband’s parents to come and live with
them, and made frequent presents of money to the elder
brother; so that her husband said, “Well, at any rate,
you bear no malice.” “Your brother’s behaviour,” replied
she, “was from his regard for you. Had it not been
for him, you and I would never have met.” After this
there were no more supernatural manifestations.</p>

<br/>
THE MAN WHO WAS THROWN DOWN
A WELL.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Tai</span>, of An-ch‘ing, was a wild fellow when young.
One day as he was returning home tipsy,<a id="Anchor-292" title="Go to Footnote 292" href="#Footnote-292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> he met by the
way a dead cousin of his named Chi; and having, in his
drunken state, quite forgotten that his cousin was dead,
he asked him where he was going. “I am already a
disembodied spirit,” replied Chi; “don’t you remember?”
Tai was a little disturbed at this; but, being
<span class="pagenum" title="i-366"><a id="Page_i-366"></a></span>
under the influence of liquor, he was not frightened, and
inquired of his cousin what he was doing in the realms
below. “I am employed as scribe,” said Chi, “in the
court of the Great King.” “Then you must know all
about our happiness and misfortunes to come,” cried
Tai. “It is my business,” answered his cousin, “so of
course I know. But I see such an enormous mass that,
unless of special reference to myself or family, I take
no notice of any of it. Three days ago, by the way,
I saw your name in the register.” Tai immediately
asked what there was about himself, and his cousin
replied, “I will not deceive you; your name was
put down for a dark and dismal hell.” Tai was
dreadfully alarmed, and at the same time sobered, and
entreated his cousin to assist him in some way. “You
may try,” said Chi, “what merit will do for you as a
means of mitigating your punishment; but the register
of your sins is as thick as my finger, and nothing short
of the most deserving acts will be of any avail. What
can a poor fellow like myself do for you? Were you to
perform one good act every day, you would not complete
the necessary total under a year and more, and it is now
too late for that. But henceforth amend your ways, and
there may still be a chance of escape for you.” When
Tai heard these words he prostrated himself on the
ground, imploring his cousin to help him; but, on raising
his head, Chi had disappeared; he therefore returned
sorrowfully home, and set to work to cleanse his heart
and order his behaviour.</p>

<p>Now Tai’s next door neighbour had long suspected
<span class="pagenum" title="i-367"><a id="Page_i-367"></a></span>
him of paying too much attention to his wife; and one
day meeting Tai in the fields shortly after the events
narrated above, he inveigled him into inspecting a dry
well, and then pushed him down. The well was many
feet deep, and the man felt certain that Tai was killed;
however, in the middle of the night he came round, and
sitting up at the bottom, he began to shout for assistance,
but could not make any one hear him. On the following
day, the neighbour, fearing that Tai might possibly have
recovered consciousness, went to listen at the mouth of
the well; and hearing him cry out for help, began to
throw down a quantity of stones. Tai took refuge in a
cave at the side, and did not dare utter another sound;
but his enemy knew he was not dead, and forthwith
filled the well almost up to the top with earth. In the
cave it was as dark as pitch, exactly like the Infernal
Regions; and not being able to get anything to eat or
drink, Tai gave up all hopes of life. He crawled on his
hands and knees further into the cave, but was prevented
by water from going further than a few paces, and
returned to take up his position at the old spot. At first
he felt hungry; by-and-by, however, this sensation passed
away; and then reflecting that there, at the bottom of a
well, he could hardly perform any good action, he passed
his time in calling loudly on the name of Buddha.<a id="Anchor-293" title="Go to Footnote 293" href="#Footnote-293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
<span class="pagenum" title="i-368"><a id="Page_i-368"></a></span>
Before long he saw a number of Will-o’-the-Wisps
flitting over the water and illuminating the gloom of the
cave; and immediately prayed to them, saying, “O
Will-o’-the-Wisps, I have heard that ye are the shades of
wronged and injured people. I have not long to live,
and am without hope of escape; still I would gladly
relieve the monotony of my situation by exchanging a
few words with you.” Thereupon, all the Wills came
flitting across the water to him; and among them was a
man of about half the ordinary size. Tai asked him
whence he came; to which he replied, “This is an old
coal-mine. The proprietor, in working the coal, disturbed
the position of some graves;<a id="Anchor-294" title="Go to Footnote 294" href="#Footnote-294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> and Mr. Lung-fei
flooded the mine and drowned forty-three workmen.
We are the shades of those men.” He further said he
did not know who Mr. Lung-fei was, except that he was
secretary to the City God, and that in compassion for the
misfortunes of the innocent workmen, he was in the
habit of sending them a quantity of gruel every three or
four days. “But the cold water,” added he, “soaks
into our bones, and there is but small chance of ever
getting them removed. If, Sir, you some day return to
the world above, I pray you fish up our decaying bones
and bury them in some public burying-ground. You
will thus earn for yourself boundless gratitude in the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-369"><a id="Page_i-369"></a></span>
realms below.” Tai promised that if he had the luck to
escape he would do as they wished; “but how,” cried
he, “situated as I am, can I ever hope to look again
upon the light of day?” He then began to teach the
Wills to say their prayers, making for them beads<a id="Anchor-295" title="Go to Footnote 295" href="#Footnote-295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> out
of bits of mud, and repeating to them the liturgies of
Buddha. He could not tell night from morning; he
slept when he felt tired, and when he waked he sat up.
Suddenly, he perceived in the distance the light of
lamps, at which the shades all rejoiced, and said, “It is
Mr. Lung-fei with our food.” They then invited Tai to
go with them; and when he said he couldn’t because of
the water, they bore him along over it so that he hardly
seemed to walk. After twisting and turning about for
nearly a quarter of a mile, he reached a place at which
the Wills bade him walk by himself; and then he appeared
to mount a flight of steps, at the top of which he
found himself in an apartment lighted by a candle as
thick round as one’s arm. Not having seen the light of
fire for some time, he was overjoyed and walked in; but
observing an old man in a scholar’s dress and cap seated
in the post of honour, he stopped, not liking to advance
further. But the old man had already caught sight of
him, and asked him how he, a living man, had come
there. Tai threw himself on the ground at his feet, and
<span class="pagenum" title="i-370"><a id="Page_i-370"></a></span>
told him all; whereupon the old man cried out, “My
great-grandson!” He then bade him get up; and
offering him a seat, explained that his own name was Tai
Ch‘ien, and that he was otherwise known as Lung-fei.
He said, moreover, that in days gone by a worthless
grandson of his named T‘ang, had associated himself
with a lot of scoundrels and sunk a well near his grave,
disturbing the peace of his everlasting night; and that
therefore he had flooded the place with salt water and
drowned them. He then inquired as to the general
condition of the family at that time.</p>

<p>Now Tai was a descendant of one of five brothers, from
the eldest of whom T‘ang himself was also descended;
and an influential man of the place had bribed T‘ang to
open a mine<a id="Anchor-296" title="Go to Footnote 296" href="#Footnote-296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> alongside the family grave. His brothers
were afraid to interfere; and by-and-by the water rose
and drowned all the workmen; whereupon actions for
damages were commenced by the relatives of the deceased,<a id="Anchor-297" title="Go to Footnote 297" href="#Footnote-297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
and T‘ang and his friend were reduced to
poverty, and T‘ang’s descendants to absolute destitution.
Tai was a son of one of T‘ang’s brothers, and having
heard this story from his seniors, now repeated it to the
old man. “How could they be otherwise than unfortunate,”
<span class="pagenum" title="i-371"><a id="Page_i-371"></a></span>
cried the latter, “with such an unfilial progenitor?
But since you have come hither, you must on
no account neglect your studies.” The old man then
provided him with food and wine, and spreading a
volume of essays according to the old style before him,
bade him study it most carefully. He also gave him
themes for composition, and corrected his essays as if he
had been his tutor. The candle remained always burning
in the room, never needing to be snuffed and never
decreasing. When he was tired he went to sleep, but
he never knew day from night. The old man occasionally
went out, leaving a boy to attend to his great-grandson’s
wants. It seemed that several years passed
away thus, but Tai had no troubles of any kind to annoy
him. He had no other book except the volume of
essays, one hundred in all, which he read through more
than four thousand times. One day the old man said to
him, “Your term of expiation is nearly completed, and
you will be able to return to the world above. My
grave is near the coal-mine, and the grosser breeze plays
upon my bones. Remember to remove them to Tung-yüan.”
Tai promised he would see to this; and then
the old man summoned all the shades together and instructed
them to escort Tai back to the place where they
had found him. The shades now bowed one after the
other, and begged Tai to think of them as well, while
Tai himself was quite at a loss to guess how he was
going to get out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tai’s family had searched for him everywhere,
and his mother had brought his case to the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-372"><a id="Page_i-372"></a></span>
notice of the officials, thereby implicating a large
number of persons, but without getting any trace of the
missing man. Three or four years passed away and
there was a change of magistrate; in consequence of
which the search was relaxed, and Tai’s wife, not being
happy where she was, married another husband. Just
then an inhabitant of the place set about repairing the
old well and found Tai’s body in the cave at the bottom.
Touching it, he found it was not dead, and at once gave
information to the family. Tai was promptly conveyed
home, and within a day he could tell his own story.</p>

<p>Since he had been down the well, the neighbour who
pushed him in had beaten his own wife to death; and
his father-in-law having brought an action against him,
he had been in confinement for more than a year while
the case was being investigated.<a id="Anchor-298" title="Go to Footnote 298" href="#Footnote-298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> When released he
was a mere bag of bones;<a id="Anchor-299" title="Go to Footnote 299" href="#Footnote-299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> and then hearing that Tai
had come back to life, he was terribly alarmed and fled
away. The family tried to persuade Tai to take proceedings
against him, but this he would not do, alleging
that what had befallen him was a proper punishment for
his own bad behaviour, and had nothing to do with the
neighbour. Upon this, the said neighbour ventured to
return; and when the water in the well had dried up,
Tai hired men to go down and collect the bones, which
<span class="pagenum" title="i-373"><a id="Page_i-373"></a></span>
he put in coffins and buried all together in one place.
He next hunted up Mr. Lung-fei’s name in the family
tables of genealogy, and proceeded to sacrifice all kinds
of nice things at his tomb. By-and-by the Literary
Chancellor<a id="Anchor-300" title="Go to Footnote 300" href="#Footnote-300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> heard this strange story, and was also very
pleased with Tai’s compositions; accordingly, Tai passed
successfully through his examinations, and, having taken
his master’s degree, returned home and reburied Mr.
Lung-fei at Tung-yüan, repairing thither regularly every
spring without fail.<a id="Anchor-301" title="Go to Footnote 301" href="#Footnote-301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<h2><a id="chapter-55"><abbr title="Fifty-Five">LV.</abbr>
<br/>
THE VIRTUOUS DAUGHTER-IN-LAW.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">An Ta-ch‘êng</span> was a Chung-ch‘ing man. His father,
who had gained the master’s degree, died early; and
his brother Erh-ch‘êng was a mere boy. He himself
had married a wife from the Ch‘ên family, whose name
was Shan-hu; and this young lady had much to put up
with from the violent and malicious disposition of her
husband’s mother.<a id="Anchor-302" title="Go to Footnote 302" href="#Footnote-302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> However, she never complained;
and every morning dressed herself up smart, and went
in to pay her respects to the old lady. Once when
Ta-ch‘êng was ill, his mother abused Shan-hu for dressing
so nicely; whereupon Shan-hu went back and changed
her clothes; but even then Mrs. An was not satisfied, and
began to tear her own hair with rage. Ta-ch‘êng, who
was a very filial son, at once gave his wife a beating,
and this put an end to the scene. From that moment
his mother hated her more than ever, and although she
was everything that a daughter-in-law could be, would
<span class="pagenum" title="i-375"><a id="Page_i-375"></a></span>
never exchange a word with her. Ta-ch‘êng then
treated her in much the same way, that his mother
might see he would have nothing to do with her; still
the old lady wasn’t pleased, and was always blaming
Shan-hu for every trifle that occurred. “A wife,”
cried Ta-ch‘êng “is taken to wait upon her mother-in-law.
This state of things hardly looks like the wife
doing her duty.” So he bade Shan-hu begone,<a id="Anchor-303" title="Go to Footnote 303" href="#Footnote-303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> and
sent an old maid-servant to see her home: but when
Shan-hu got outside the village-gate, she burst into
tears, and said, “How can a girl who has failed in her
duties as a wife ever dare to look her parents in the face?
I had better die.” Thereupon she drew a pair of scissors
and stabbed herself in the throat, covering herself immediately
with blood. The servant prevented any further
mischief, and supported her to the house of her husband’s
aunt, who was a widow living by herself, and who
made Shan-hu stay with her. The servant went back
and told Ta-ch‘êng, and he bade her say nothing to any
one, for fear his mother should hear of it. In a few
days Shan-hu’s wound was healed, and Ta-ch‘êng went
off to ask his aunt to send her away. His aunt invited
him in, but he declined, demanding loudly that
Shan-hu should be turned out; and in a few moments
Shan-hu herself came forth, and inquired what she had
done. Ta-ch‘êng said she had failed in her duty towards
his mother; whereupon Shan-hu hung her head
<span class="pagenum" title="i-376"><a id="Page_i-376"></a></span>
and made no answer, while tears of blood<a id="Anchor-304" title="Go to Footnote 304" href="#Footnote-304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> trickled
from her eyes and stained her dress all over. Ta-ch‘êng
was much touched by this spectacle, and went away
without saying any more; but before long his mother
heard all about it, and, hurrying off to the aunt’s, began
abusing her roundly. This the aunt would not stand,
and said it was all the fault of her own bad temper,
adding, “The girl has already left you, and has nothing
more to do with the family. Miss Ch‘ên is staying with
me, not your daughter-in-law; so you had better mind
your own business.” This made Mrs. An furious; but
she was at a loss for an answer, and, seeing that the
aunt was firm, she went off home abashed and in tears.</p>

<p>Shan-hu herself was very much upset, and determined
to seek shelter elsewhere, finally taking up her
abode with Mrs. An’s elder sister, a lady of sixty odd
years of age, whose son had died, leaving his wife and
child to his mother’s care. This Mrs. Yü was extremely
fond of Shan-hu; and when she heard the facts of the
case, said it was all her sister’s horrid disposition, and
proposed to send Shan-hu back. The latter, however,
would not hear of this, and they continued to live together
like mother and daughter; neither would Shan-hu
accept the invitation of her two brothers to return
home and marry some one else, but remained there with
<span class="pagenum" title="i-377"><a id="Page_i-377"></a></span>
Mrs. Yü, earning enough to live upon by spinning and
such work.</p>

<p>Ever since Shan-hu had been sent away, Ta-ch‘êng’s
mother had been endeavouring to get him another wife;
but the fame of her temper had spread far and wide,
and no one would entertain her proposals. In three or
four years Erh-ch‘êng had grown up, and he was married
first to a young lady named Tsang-ku, whose temper
turned out to be something fearful, and far more ungovernable
even than her mother-in-law’s. When the
latter only looked angry, Tsang-ku was already at the
shrieking stage; and Erh-ch‘êng, being of a very meek
disposition, dared not side with either. Thus it came
about that Mrs. An began to be in mortal fear of
Tsang-ku; and whenever her daughter-in-law was in a
rage she would try and turn off her anger with a smile.
She seemed never to be able to please Tsang-ku, who in
her turn worked her mother-in-law like a slave, Ta-ch‘êng
himself not venturing to interfere, but only assisting his
mother in washing the dishes and sweeping the floor.
Mother and son would often go to some secluded spot,
and there in secret tell their griefs to one another; but
before long Mrs. An was stretched upon a sick bed with
nobody to attend to her except Ta-ch‘êng. He watched
her day and night without sleeping, until both eyes were
red and inflamed; and then when he went to summon
the younger son to take his place, Tsang-ku told him to
leave the house. Ta-ch‘êng now went off to inform
Mrs. Yü, hoping that she would come and assist; and
he had hardly finished his tale of woe before Shan-hu
<span class="pagenum" title="i-378"><a id="Page_i-378"></a></span>
walked in. In great confusion at seeing her, he would
have left immediately had not <a id="tn_3">Shan-hu</a> held out her arms
across the door; whereupon he bolted underneath them
and escaped. He did not dare tell his mother, and
shortly afterwards Mrs. Yü arrived, to the great joy of Ta-ch‘êng’s
mother, who made her stay in the house.
Every day something nice was sent for Mrs. Yü, and
even when she told the servants that there was no
occasion for it, she having all she wanted at her sister’s,
the things still came as usual. However, she kept none
of them for herself, but gave what came to the invalid,
who gradually began to improve. Mrs. Yü’s grandson
also used to come by his mother’s orders, and inquire
after the sick lady’s health, besides bringing a packet
of cakes and so on for her. “Ah, me!” cried Mrs.
An, “what a good daughter-in-law you have got, to be
sure. What have you done to her?” “What sort of
a person was the one you sent away?” asked her sister
in reply. “She wasn’t as bad as some one I know of,”
said Mrs. An, “though not so good as yours.” “When
she was here you had but little to do,” replied Mrs. Yü;
“and when you were angry she took no notice of it.
How was she not as good?” Mrs. An then burst into
tears, and saying how sorry she was, asked if Shan-hu
had married again; to which Mrs. Yü replied that she
did not know, but would make inquiries. In a few
more days the patient was quite well, and Mrs. Yü
proposed to return; her sister, however, begged her to
stay, and declared she should die if she didn’t. Mrs.
Yü then advised that Erh-ch‘êng and his wife should
<span class="pagenum" title="i-379"><a id="Page_i-379"></a></span>
live in a separate house, and Erh-ch‘êng spoke about
it to his wife; but she would not agree, and abused
both Ta-ch‘êng and his mother alike. It ended by
Ta-ch‘êng giving up a large share of the property, and
ultimately Tsang-ku consented, and a deed of separation
was drawn up. Mrs. Yü then went away, returning
next day with a sedan-chair to carry her sister back;
and no sooner had the latter put her foot inside Mrs.
Yü’s door, than she asked to see the daughter-in-law,
whom she immediately began to praise very highly.
“Ah,” said Mrs. Yü, “she’s a good girl, with her little
faults like the rest of us; but your daughter-in-law is
just as good, though you are not aware of it.”
“Alas!” replied her sister, “I must have been as
senseless as a statue not to have seen what she was.”
“I wonder what Shan-hu, whom you turned out of
doors, says of you,” rejoined Mrs. Yü. “Why, swears
at me, of course,” answered Mrs. An. “If you examine
yourself honestly and find nothing which should
make people swear at you, is it at all likely you would
be sworn at?” asked Mrs. Yü. “Well, all people are
fallible,” replied the other, “and as I know she is not
perfect, I conclude she would naturally swear at me.”
“If a person has just cause for resentment, and yet
does not indulge that resentment, such behaviour should
meet with a grateful acknowledgment; or if any one
has just cause for leaving another and yet does not do
so, such behaviour should entitle them to kind treatment.
Now, all the things that were sent when you
were ill, and all the various little attentions, did not
<span class="pagenum" title="i-380"><a id="Page_i-380"></a></span>
come from my daughter-in-law but from yours.” Mrs.
An was amazed at hearing this, and asked for some
explanation; whereupon Mrs. Yü continued, “Shan-hu
has been living here for a long time. Everything she
sent to you was bought with money earned by her
spinning, and that, too, continued late into the night.”
Mrs. An here burst into tears, and begged to be
allowed to see Shan-hu, who came in at Mrs. Yü’s
summons, and threw herself on the ground at her
mother-in-law’s feet. Mrs. An was much abashed, and
beat her head with shame; but Mrs. Yü made it all up
between them, and they became mother and daughter
as at first. In about ten days they went home, and, as
their property was not enough to support them, Ta-ch‘êng
had to work with his pen while his wife did the
same with her needle. Erh-ch‘êng was quite well off,
but his brother would not apply to him, neither did he
himself offer to help them. Tsang-ku, too, would have
nothing to do with her sister-in-law, because she had
been divorced; and Shan-hu in her turn, knowing what
Tsang-ku’s temper was, made no great efforts to be
friendly. So the two brothers lived apart;<a id="Anchor-305" title="Go to Footnote 305" href="#Footnote-305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> and when
Tsang-ku was in one of her outrageous moods, all the
others would stop their ears, till at length there was only
her husband and the servants upon whom to vent her
spleen. One day a maid-servant of hers committed
<span class="pagenum" title="i-381"><a id="Page_i-381"></a></span>
suicide, and the father of the girl brought an action
against Tsang-ku for having caused her death. Erh-ch‘êng
went off to the mandarin’s to take her place as
defendant, but only got a good beating for his pains,
as the magistrate insisted that Tsang-ku herself should
appear, and answer to the charge, in spite of all her
friends could do. The consequence was she had her
fingers squeezed<a id="Anchor-306" title="Go to Footnote 306" href="#Footnote-306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> until the flesh was entirely taken off;
and the magistrate, being a grasping man, a very
severe fine was inflicted as well. Erh-ch‘êng had now
to mortgage his property before he could raise enough
money to get Tsang-ku released; but before long the
mortgagee threatened to foreclose, and he was obliged
to enter into negotiations for the sale of it to an old
gentleman of the village named Jen. Now Mr. Jen,
knowing that half the property had belonged to Ta-ch‘êng,
said the deed of sale must be signed by the
elder brother as well; however, when Ta-ch‘êng reached
his house, the old man cried out, “I am Mr. An, <abbr title="Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr>,
who is this Jen that he should buy my property?”
Then, looking at Ta-ch‘êng, he added, “The filial piety
<span class="pagenum" title="i-382"><a id="Page_i-382"></a></span>
of you and your wife has obtained for me in the realms
below this interview;” upon which Ta-ch‘êng said, “O
father, since you have this power, help my younger
brother.” “The unfilial son and the vixenish daughter-in-law,”
said the old man, “deserve no pity. Go home
and quickly buy back our ancestral property.” “We
have barely enough to live upon,” replied Ta-ch‘êng;
“where, then, shall we find the necessary money?” “Beneath
the crape myrtle-tree,”<a id="Anchor-307" title="Go to Footnote 307" href="#Footnote-307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> answered his father,
“you will find a store of silver, which you may take
and use for this purpose.” Ta-ch‘êng would have
questioned him further, but the old gentleman said no
more, recovering consciousness shortly afterwards<a id="Anchor-308" title="Go to Footnote 308" href="#Footnote-308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> without
knowing a word of what had happened. Ta-ch‘êng
went back and told his brother, who did not altogether
believe the story; Tsang-ku, however, hurried off with
a number of men, and had soon dug a hole four or five
feet deep, at the bottom of which they found a quantity
of bricks and stones, but no gold. She then gave up
the idea and returned home, Ta-ch‘êng having meanwhile
warned his mother and wife not to go near the
place while she was digging. When Tsang-ku left,
Mrs. An went herself to have a look, and seeing only
bricks and earth mingled together, she, too, retraced her
steps. Shan-hu was the next to go, and she found the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-383"><a id="Page_i-383"></a></span>
hole full of silver bullion; and then Ta-ch‘êng repaired
to the spot and saw that there was no mistake about
it. Not thinking it right to apply this heir-loom to his
own private use, he now summoned Erh-ch‘êng to share
it; and having obtained twice as much as was necessary
to redeem the estate, the brothers returned to
their homes. Erh-ch‘êng and Tsang-ku opened their
half together, when lo! the bag was full of tiles and
rubbish. They at once suspected Ta-ch‘êng of deceiving
them, and Erh-ch‘êng ran off to see how things
were going at his brother’s. He arrived just as Ta-ch‘êng
was spreading the silver on the table, and with
his mother and wife rejoicing over their acquisition;
and when he had told them what had occurred, Ta-ch‘êng
expressed much sympathy for him, and at once
presented him with his own half of the treasure.
Erh-ch‘êng was delighted, and paid off the mortgage on
the land, feeling very grateful to his brother for such
kindness. Tsang-ku, however, declared it was a proof
that Ta-ch‘êng had been cheating him; “for how, otherwise,”
argued she, “can you understand a man sharing
anything with another, and then resigning his own
half?”</p>

<p>Erh-ch‘êng himself did not know what to think of it;
but next day the mortgagee sent to say that the money
paid in was all imitation silver, and that he was about to
lay the case before the authorities. Husband and wife
were greatly alarmed at this, and Tsang-ku exclaimed,
“Well, I never thought your brother was as bad as
this. He’s simply trying to take your life.” Erh-ch‘êng
<span class="pagenum" title="i-384"><a id="Page_i-384"></a></span>
himself was in a terrible fright, and hurried off
to the mortgagee to entreat for mercy; but as the latter
was extremely angry and would hear of no compromise,
Erh-ch‘êng was obliged to make over the property to
him to dispose of himself. The money was then
returned, and when he got home he found that two
lumps had been cut through, shewing merely an outside
layer of silver, about as thick as an onion-leaf, covering
nothing but copper within. Tsang-ku and Erh-ch‘êng
then agreed to keep the broken pieces themselves, but
send the rest back to Ta-ch‘êng, with a message, saying
that they were deeply indebted to him for all his kindness,
and that they had ventured to retain two of the
lumps of silver out of compliment to the giver; also
that Ta-ch‘êng might consider himself the owner of the
mortgaged land, which he could redeem or not as he
pleased. Ta-ch‘êng, who did not perceive the intention
in all this, refused to accept the land; however, Erh-ch‘êng
entreated him to do so, and at last he consented.
When he came to weigh the money, he found it was
five ounces short, and therefore bade Shan-hu pawn
something from her jewel-box to make up the amount,
with which he proceeded to pay off the mortgage. The
mortgagee, suspecting it was the same money that had
been offered him by Erh-ch‘êng, cut the pieces in
halves, and saw that it was all silver of the purest
quality. Accordingly he accepted it in liquidation
of his claim, and handed the mortgage back to Ta-ch‘êng.
Meanwhile, Erh-ch‘êng had been expecting
some catastrophe; but when he found that the mortgaged
<span class="pagenum" title="i-385"><a id="Page_i-385"></a></span>
land had been redeemed, he did not know what
to make of it. Tsang-ku thought that at the time of
the digging Ta-ch‘êng had concealed the genuine silver,
and immediately rushed off to his house, and began to
revile them all round. Ta-ch‘êng now understood why
they had sent him back the money; and Shan-hu
laughed and said, “The property is safe; why, then, this
anger?” Thereupon she made Ta-ch‘êng hand over
the deeds to Tsang-ku.</p>

<p>One night after this Erh-ch‘êng’s father appeared to
him in a dream, and reproached him, saying, “Unfilial
son, unfraternal brother, your hour is at hand. Wherefore
usurp rights that do not belong to you?” In the
morning Erh-ch‘êng told Tsang-ku of his dream, and
proposed to return the property to his brother; but she
only laughed at him for a fool. Just then the eldest
of his two sons, a boy of seven, died of small-pox, and
this frightened Tsang-ku so that she agreed to restore
the deeds. Ta-ch‘êng would not accept them; and
now the second child, a boy of three, died also; whereupon
Tsang-ku seized the deeds, and threw them into
her brother-in-law’s house. Spring was over, but the
land was in a terribly neglected state; so Ta-ch‘êng
set to work and put it in order again. From this moment
Tsang-ku was a changed woman towards her mother-
and sister-in-law; and when, six months later, Mrs. An
died, she was so grieved that she refused to take any
nourishment. “Alas!” cried she, “that my mother-in-law
has died thus early, and prevented me from waiting
upon her. Heaven will not allow me to retrieve my
<span class="pagenum" title="i-386"><a id="Page_i-386"></a></span>
past errors.” Tsang-ku had thirteen children,<a id="Anchor-309" title="Go to Footnote 309" href="#Footnote-309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> but as
none of them lived, they were obliged to adopt one of
Ta-ch‘êng’s,<a id="Anchor-310" title="Go to Footnote 310" href="#Footnote-310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> who, with his wife, lived to a good old
age, and had three sons, two of whom took their
doctor’s degree. People said this was a reward for filial
piety and brotherly love.</p>

<h2><a id="chapter-56"><abbr title="Fifty-Six">LVI.</abbr>
<br/>
DR. TSÊNG’S DREAM.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">There</span> was a Fohkien gentleman named Tsêng, who
had just taken his doctor’s degree. One day he was out
walking with several other recently-elected doctors, when
they heard that at a temple hard by there lived an
astrologer, and accordingly the party proceeded thither to
get their fortunes told. They went in and sat down, and
the astrologer made some very complimentary remarks
to Tsêng, at which he fanned himself and smiled, saying,
“Have I any chance of ever wearing the dragon robes
and the jade girdle?”<a id="Anchor-311" title="Go to Footnote 311" href="#Footnote-311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> The astrologer<a id="Anchor-312" title="Go to Footnote 312" href="#Footnote-312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> immediately put
on a serious face, and replied that he would be a Secretary
of State during twenty years of national tranquillity.
Thereupon Tsêng was much pleased, and began to give
himself greater airs than ever. A slight rain coming on,
they sought shelter in the priest’s quarters, where they
found an old bonze, with sunken eyes and a big nose,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-388"><a id="Page_i-388"></a></span>
sitting upon a mat. He took no notice of the strangers,
who, after having bowed to him, stretched themselves
upon the couches to chat, not forgetting to congratulate
Tsêng upon the destiny which had been foretold him.
Tsêng, too, seemed to think the thing was a matter
of certainty, and mentioned the names of several
friends he intended to advance, amongst others the
old family butler. Roars of laughter greeted this
announcement, mingled with the patter-patter of the
increasing rain outside. Tsêng then curled himself up
for a nap, when suddenly in walked two officials bearing
a commission under the Great Seal appointing Tsêng
to the Grand Secretariat. As soon as Tsêng understood
their errand, he rushed off at once to pay his respects
to the Emperor, who graciously detained him some
time in conversation, and then issued instructions that
the promotion and dismissal of all officers below the
third grade<a id="Anchor-313" title="Go to Footnote 313" href="#Footnote-313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> should be vested in Tsêng alone. He was
next presented with the dragon robes, the jade girdle,
and a horse from the imperial stables, after which he
performed the <i>ko-t‘ow</i><a id="Anchor-314" title="Go to Footnote 314" href="#Footnote-314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> before His Majesty and took his
leave. He then went home, but it was no longer the old
home of his youth. Painted beams, carved pillars, and
a general profusion of luxury and elegance, made him
wonder where on earth he was; until, nervously stroking
<span class="pagenum" title="i-389"><a id="Page_i-389"></a></span>
his beard, he ventured to call out in a low tone. Immediately
the responses of numberless attendants echoed
through the place like thunder. Presents of costly food
were sent to him by all the grandees, and his gate was
absolutely blocked up by the crowds of retainers who
were constantly coming and going. When Privy Councillors
came to see him, he would rush out in haste to
receive them; when Under-Secretaries of State visited
him, he made them a polite bow; but to all below these
he would hardly vouchsafe a word. The Governor of
Shansi sent him twelve singing-girls, two of whom, Ni-ni
and Fairy, he made his favourites. All day long he had
nothing to do but find amusement as best he could, until
he bethought himself that formerly a man named Wang
had often assisted him with money. Thereupon he
memorialized the Throne and obtained official employment
for him. Then he recollected that there was
another man to whom he owed a long-standing grudge.
He at once caused this man, who was in the Government
service, to be impeached and stripped of his rank and
dignities. Thus he squared accounts with both. One
day when out in his chair a drunken man bumped
against one of his tablet-bearers.<a id="Anchor-315" title="Go to Footnote 315" href="#Footnote-315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Tsêng had him
<span class="pagenum" title="i-390"><a id="Page_i-390"></a></span>
seized and sent in to the mayor’s yamên, where he died
under the bamboo. Owners of land adjoining his would
make him a present of the richest portions, fearing the
consequences if they did not do so; and thus he became
very wealthy, almost on a par with the State itself. By-and-by,
Ni-ni and Fairy died, and Tsêng was overwhelmed
with grief. Suddenly he remembered that
in former years he had seen a beautiful girl whom he
wished to purchase as a concubine, but want of money
had then prevented him from carrying out his intention.
Now there was no longer that difficulty; and accordingly
he sent off two trusty servants to get the girl by force.
In a short time she arrived, when he found that she had
grown more beautiful than ever; and so his cup of happiness
was full. But years rolled on, and gradually his
fellow-officials became estranged, Tsêng taking no notice
of their behaviour, until at last one of them impeached
him to the Throne in a long and bitter memorial.
Happily, however, the Emperor still regarded him with
favour, and for some time kept the memorial by him
<span class="pagenum" title="i-391"><a id="Page_i-391"></a></span>
unanswered. Then followed a joint memorial from the
whole of the Privy Council, including those who had once
thronged his doors, and had falsely called him their dear
father. The Imperial rescript to this document was
“Banishment to Yunnan,”<a id="Anchor-316" title="Go to Footnote 316" href="#Footnote-316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> his son, who was Governor of
P‘ing-yang, being also implicated in his guilt. When
Tsêng heard the news, he was overcome with fear; but an
armed guard was already at his gate, and the lictors were
forcing their way into his innermost apartments. They
tore off his robe and official hat, and bound him and his
wife with cords. Then they collected together in the hall
his gold, his silver, and bank-notes,<a id="Anchor-317" title="Go to Footnote 317" href="#Footnote-317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> to the value of many
hundred thousands of taels. His pearls, and jade, and
precious stones filled many bushel baskets. His curtains,
and screens, and beds, and other articles of furniture
were brought out by thousands; while the swaddling-clothes
of his infant boy and the shoes of his little girl
were lying littered about the steps. It was a sad sight
for Tsêng; but a worse blow was that of his concubine
carried off almost lifeless before his eyes, himself not
daring to utter a word. Then all the apartments, store-rooms,
and treasuries were sealed up; and, with a volley
of curses, the soldiers bade Tsêng begone, and proceeded
to leave the place, dragging Tsêng with them. The
<span class="pagenum" title="i-392"><a id="Page_i-392"></a></span>
husband and wife prayed that they might be allowed
some old cart, but this favour was denied them. After
about ten <i>li</i>, Tsêng’s wife could barely walk, her feet
being swollen and sore. Tsêng helped her along as
best he could, but another ten <i>li</i> reduced him to a state
of abject fatigue. By-and-by they saw before them a
great mountain, the summit of which was lost in the
clouds; and, fearing they should be made to ascend it,
Tsêng and his wife stood still and began to weep. The
lictors, however, clamoured round them, and would
permit of no rest. The sun was rapidly sinking, and
there was no place at hand where they could obtain
shelter for the night. So they continued on their weary
way until about half-way up the hill, when his wife’s
strength was quite exhausted, and she sat down by the
roadside. Tsêng, too, halted to rest in spite of the
soldiers and their abuse; but they had hardly stopped a
moment before down came a band of robbers upon
them, each with a sharp knife in his hand. The soldiers
immediately took to their heels, and Tsêng fell on his
knees before the robbers, saying, “I am a poor criminal
going into banishment, and have nothing to give you.
I pray you spare my life.” But the robbers sternly
replied, “We are all the victims of your crimes, and now
we want your wicked head.” Then Tsêng began to
revile them, saying, “Dogs! though I am under sentence
of banishment, I am still an officer of the State.” But
the robbers cursed him again, flourishing a sword over
his neck, and the next thing he heard was the noise
of his own head as it fell with a thud to the ground. At
<span class="pagenum" title="i-393"><a id="Page_i-393"></a></span>
the same instant two devils stepped forward and seized
him each by one hand, compelling him to go with them.
After a little while they arrived at a great city where there
was a hideously ugly king sitting upon a throne judging
between good and evil. Tsêng crawled before him on
his hands and knees to receive sentence, and the king,
after turning over a few pages of his register, thundered
out, “The punishment of a traitor who has brought
misfortune on his country: the cauldron of boiling
oil!” To this ten thousand devils responded with a cry
like a clap of thunder, and one huge monster led Tsêng
down alongside the cauldron, which was seven feet in
height, and surrounded on all sides by blazing fuel, so
that it was of a glowing red heat. Tsêng shrieked for
mercy, but it was all up with him, for the devil seized
him by the hair and the small of his back and pitched
him headlong in. Down he fell with a splash, and rose
and sank with the bubbling of the oil, which ate through
his flesh into his very vitals. He longed to die, but
death would not come to him. After about half-an-hour’s
boiling, a devil took him out on a pitchfork and
threw him down before the Infernal King, who again
consulted his note-book, and said, “You relied on your
position to treat others with contumely and injustice, for
which you must suffer on the Sword-Hill.” Again he
was led away by devils to a large hill thickly studded
with sharp swords, their points upwards like the shoots of
bamboo, with here and there the remains of many
miserable wretches who had suffered before him. Tsêng
again cried for mercy and crouched upon the ground;
<span class="pagenum" title="i-394"><a id="Page_i-394"></a></span>
but a devil bored into him with a poisoned awl until he
screamed with pain. He was then seized and flung up
high into the air, falling down right on the sword points,
to his most frightful agony. This was repeated several
times until he was almost hacked to pieces. He was
then brought once more before the king, who asked what
was the amount of his peculations while on earth. Immediately
an accountant came forward with an abacus,
and said that the whole sum was 3,210,000 taels, whereupon
the king replied, “Let him drink that amount.”
Forthwith the devils piled up a great heap of gold and
silver, and, when they had melted it in a huge crucible,
began pouring it into Tsêng’s mouth. The pain was
excruciating as the molten metal ran down his throat
into his vitals; but since in life he had never been able
to get enough of the dross, it was determined he should
feel no lack of it then. He was half-a-day drinking it,
and then the king ordered him away to be born again as
a woman<a id="Anchor-318" title="Go to Footnote 318" href="#Footnote-318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> in Kan-chou. A few steps brought them
to a huge frame, where on an iron axle revolved a mighty
wheel many hundred <i>yojanas</i><a id="Anchor-319" title="Go to Footnote 319" href="#Footnote-319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> in circumference, and
shining with a brilliant light. The devils flogged Tsêng
on to the wheel, and he shut his eyes as he stepped up.
Then whiz&mdash;and away he went, feet foremost, round
with the wheel, until he felt himself tumble off and a
<span class="pagenum" title="i-395"><a id="Page_i-395"></a></span>
cold thrill ran through him, when he opened his eyes
and found he was changed into a girl. He saw his
father and mother in rags and tatters, and in one corner
a beggar’s bowl and a staff,<a id="Anchor-320" title="Go to Footnote 320" href="#Footnote-320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> and understood the
calamity that had befallen him. Day after day he
begged about the streets, and his inside rumbled for
want of food; he had no clothes to his back. At fourteen
years of age he was sold to a gentleman as concubine;
and then, though food and clothes were not
wanting, he had to put up with the scoldings and
floggings of the wife, who one day burnt him with a
hot iron.<a id="Anchor-321" title="Go to Footnote 321" href="#Footnote-321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Luckily the gentleman took a fancy to him
and treated him well, which kindness Tsêng repaid by an
irreproachable fidelity. It happened, however, that on
one occasion when they were chatting together, burglars
broke into the house and killed the gentleman, Tsêng
having escaped by hiding himself under the bed. Thereupon
he was immediately charged by the wife with murder,
and on being taken before the authorities was sentenced
<span class="pagenum" title="i-396"><a id="Page_i-396"></a></span>
to die the “lingering death.”<a id="Anchor-322" title="Go to Footnote 322" href="#Footnote-322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> This sentence was at once
carried out with tortures more horrible than any in all the
Courts of Purgatory, in the middle of which Tsêng
heard one of his companions call out, “Hullo, there!
you’ve got the nightmare.” Tsêng got up and rubbed
his eyes, and his friends said, “It’s quite late in the day,
and we’re all very hungry.” But the old priest smiled,
and asked him if the prophecy as to his future rank was
true or not. Tsêng bowed and begged him to explain;
whereupon the old priest said, “For those who cultivate
virtue, a lily will grow up even in the fiery pit.”<a id="Anchor-323" title="Go to Footnote 323" href="#Footnote-323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Tsêng
had gone thither full of pride and vainglory; he went
home an altered man. From that day he thought no
more of becoming a Secretary of State, but retired into
the hills, and I know not what became of him after
that.</p>

THE COUNTRY OF THE CANNIBALS.</a><a id="Anchor-324" title="Go to Footnote 324" href="#Footnote-324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Chiao-chou<a id="Anchor-325" title="Go to Footnote 325" href="#Footnote-325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> there lived a man named Hsü, who
gained his living by trading across the sea. On one
occasion he was carried far out of his course by a violent
tempest, and reached a country of high hills and dense
jungle,<a id="Anchor-326" title="Go to Footnote 326" href="#Footnote-326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> where, after making fast his boat and taking
provisions with him, he landed, hoping to meet with
some of the inhabitants. He then saw that the rocks
were covered with large holes, like the cells of bees;
and, hearing the sound of voices from within, he stopped
in front of one of them and peeped in. To his infinite
horror he beheld two hideous beings, with thick rows of
horrid fangs, and eyes that glared like lamps, engaged in
tearing to pieces and devouring some raw deer’s flesh;
and, turning round, he would have fled instantly from
<span class="pagenum" title="i-398"><a id="Page_i-398"></a></span>
the spot, had not the cave-men already espied him; and,
leaving their food, they seized him and dragged him in.
Thereupon ensued a chattering between them, resembling
the noise of birds or beasts,<a id="Anchor-327" title="Go to Footnote 327" href="#Footnote-327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> and they proceeded
to pull off Hsü’s clothes as if about to eat him; but
Hsü, who was frightened almost to death, offered them
the food he had in his wallet, which they ate up with
great relish, and looked inside for more. Hsü waved his
hand to shew it was all finished, and then they angrily
seized him again; at which he cried out, “I have a
saucepan in my boat, and can cook you some.” The
cave-men did not understand what he said; but, by dint
of gesticulating freely, they at length seemed to have an
idea of what he meant; and, having taken him down to
the shore to fetch the saucepan, they returned with him
to the cave, where he lighted a fire and cooked the remainder
of the deer, with the flavour of which they
appeared to be mightily pleased. At night they rolled a
big stone to the mouth of the cave,<a id="Anchor-328" title="Go to Footnote 328" href="#Footnote-328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> fearing lest he
should try to escape; and Hsü himself lay down at a
distance from them in doubt as to whether his life would
be spared. At daybreak the cave-men went out, leaving
<span class="pagenum" title="i-399"><a id="Page_i-399"></a></span>
the entrance blocked, and by-and-by came back with a
deer, which they gave to Hsü to cook. Hsü flayed the
carcase, and from a remote corner of the cave took
some water and prepared a large quantity, which was no
sooner ready than several other cave-men arrived to join
in the feast. When they had finished all there was, they
made signs that Hsü’s saucepan was too small; and
three or four days afterwards they brought him a large
one of the same shape as those in common use amongst
men, subsequently furnishing him with constant supplies
of wolf and deer,<a id="Anchor-329" title="Go to Footnote 329" href="#Footnote-329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> of which they always invited him to
partake. By degrees they began to treat him kindly,
and not to shut him up when they went out; and Hsü,
too, gradually learnt to understand, and even to speak, a
little of their language, which pleased them so much that
they finally gave him a cave-woman for his wife. Hsü
was horribly afraid of her; but, as she treated him with
great consideration, always reserving tit-bits of food for
him, they lived very happily together. One day all the
cave-people got up early in the morning, and, having
adorned themselves with strings of fine pearls, they went
forth as if to meet some honoured guest, giving orders
to Hsü to cook an extra quantity of meat that day. “It
is the birthday of our King,” said Hsü’s wife to him;
and then, running out, she informed the other cave-people
<span class="pagenum" title="i-400"><a id="Page_i-400"></a></span>
that her husband had no pearls. So each gave
five from his own string, and Hsü’s wife added ten to
these, making in all fifty, which she threaded on a
hempen fibre and hung around his neck, each pearl being
worth over an hundred ounces of silver. Then they went
away, and as soon as Hsü had finished his cooking, his
wife appeared and invited him to come and receive the
King. So off they went to a huge cavern, covering
about a mow<a id="Anchor-330" title="Go to Footnote 330" href="#Footnote-330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> of ground, in which was a huge stone,
smoothed away at the top like a table, with stone seats
at the four sides. At the upper end was a dais, over
which was spread a leopard’s skin, the other seats having
only deer-skins; and within the cavern some twenty or
thirty cave-men ranged themselves on the seats. After a
short interval a great wind began to stir up the dust, and
they all rushed out to a creature very much resembling
themselves, which hurried into the cave, and, squatting
down cross-legged, cocked its head and looked about
like a cormorant. The other cave-men then filed in and
took up their positions right and left of the dais, where
they stood gazing up at the King with their arms folded
before them in the form of a cross. The King counted
them one by one, and asked if they were all present;
and when they replied in the affirmative, he looked at
Hsü and inquired who he was. Thereupon Hsü’s wife
<span class="pagenum" title="i-401"><a id="Page_i-401"></a></span>
stepped forward and said he was her husband, and the
others all loudly extolled his skill in cookery, two of
them running out and bringing back some cooked meat,
which they set before the King. His Majesty swallowed
it by handfuls, and found it so nice that he gave orders
to be supplied regularly; and then, turning to Hsü, he
asked him why his string of beads<a id="Anchor-331" title="Go to Footnote 331" href="#Footnote-331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> was so short. “He
has but recently arrived among us,” replied the cave-men,
“and hasn’t got a complete set;” upon which the
King drew ten pearls from the string round his own
neck and bestowed them upon Hsü. Each was as big
as the top of one’s finger, and as round as a bullet; and
Hsü’s wife threaded them for him and hung them round
his neck. Hsü himself crossed his arms and thanked
the King in the language of the country, after which
His Majesty went off in a gust of wind as rapidly as a
bird can fly, and the cave-men sat down and finished
what was left of the banquet. Four years afterwards
Hsü’s wife gave birth to a triplet of two boys and one
girl, all of whom were ordinary human beings, and not
at all like the mother; at which the other cave-people
were delighted, and would often play with them and
caress them.<a id="Anchor-332" title="Go to Footnote 332" href="#Footnote-332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Three years passed away, and the children
<span class="pagenum" title="i-402"><a id="Page_i-402"></a></span>
could walk about, after which their father taught
them to speak his own tongue; and in their early babblings
their human origin was manifested. The boys, as
mere children, could climb about on the mountains as
easily as though walking upon a level road; and between
them and their father there grew up a mutual feeling of
attachment. One day the mother had gone out with the
girl and one of the boys, and was absent for a long time.
A strong north wind was blowing, and Hsü, filled with
thoughts of his old home, led his other son down with
him to the beach, where lay the boat in which he had
formerly reached this country. He then proposed to
the boy that they should go away together; and, having
explained to him that they could not inform his mother,
father and son stepped on board, and, after a voyage of
only twenty-four hours, arrived safely at Chiao-chou. On
reaching home Hsü found that his wife had married
again; so he sold two of his pearls for an enormous sum
of money,<a id="Anchor-333" title="Go to Footnote 333" href="#Footnote-333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> and set up a splendid establishment. His
son was called Piao, and at fourteen or fifteen years of
age the boy could lift a weight of three thousand catties<a id="Anchor-334" title="Go to Footnote 334" href="#Footnote-334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
(4,000 lbs.). He was extremely fond of athletics of all
kinds, and thus attracted the notice of the Commander-in-Chief,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-403"><a id="Page_i-403"></a></span>
who gave him a commission as sub-lieutenant.
Just at that time there happened to be some trouble on
the frontier, and young Piao, having covered himself
with glory, was made a colonel at the age of eighteen.</p>

<p>About that time another merchant was driven by
stress of weather to the country of the cave-men, and
had hardly stepped ashore before he observed a young
man whom he knew at once to be of Chinese origin.
The young man asked him whence he came, and finally
took him into a cave hid away in a dark valley and concealed
by the dense jungle. There he bade him remain,
and in a little while he returned with some deer’s flesh,
which he gave the merchant to eat, saying at the same
time that his own father was a Chiao-chou man. The
merchant now knew that the young man was Hsü’s son,
he himself being acquainted with Hsü as a trader in the
same line of business. “Why, he’s an old friend of
mine,” cried the latter; “his other son is now a colonel.”
The young man did not know what was meant by a
<i>colonel</i>, so the merchant told him it was the title of a
Chinese mandarin. “And what is a <i>mandarin?</i>” asked
the youth. “A mandarin,” replied the merchant, “is
one who goes out with a chair and horses; who at home
sits upon a dais in the hall; whose summons is answered
by a hundred voices; who is looked at only with sidelong
eyes, and in whose presence all people stand
aslant;&mdash;this is to be a mandarin.” The young man
was deeply touched at this recital, and at length the
merchant said to him, “Since your honoured father is
at Chiao-chou, why do you remain here?” “Indeed,”
<span class="pagenum" title="i-404"><a id="Page_i-404"></a></span>
replied the youth, “I have often indulged the same feeling;
but my mother is not a Chinese woman, and, apart
from the difference of her language and appearance, I
fear that if the other cave-people found it out they
would do us some mischief.” He then took his leave,
being in rather a disturbed state of mind, and bade the
merchant wait until the wind should prove favourable,<a id="Anchor-335" title="Go to Footnote 335" href="#Footnote-335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
when he promised to come and see him off, and charge
him with a letter to his father and brother. Six months
the merchant remained in that cave, occasionally taking
a peep at the cave-people passing backwards and forwards,
but not daring to leave his retreat. As soon as
the monsoon set in the young man arrived and urged
him to hurry away, begging him, also, not to forget the
letter to his father. So the merchant sailed away and
soon reached Chiao-chou, where he visited the colonel
and told him the whole story. Piao was much affected,
and wished to go in search of those members of the
family; but his father feared the dangers he would encounter,
and advised him not to think of such a thing.
However, Piao was not to be deterred; and having imparted
his scheme to the commander-in-chief, he took
with him two soldiers and set off. Adverse winds
prevailed at that time, and they beat about for half a
moon, until they were out of sight of all land, could not
see a foot before them, and had completely lost their
reckoning. Just then a mighty sea arose and capsized
<span class="pagenum" title="i-405"><a id="Page_i-405"></a></span>
their boat, tossing Piao into the water, where he floated
about for some time at the will of the waves, until suddenly
somebody dragged him out and carried him into a
house. Then he saw that his rescuer was to all appearances
a cave-man, and accordingly he addressed him in
the cave-people’s language, and told him whither he
himself was bound. “It is my native place,” replied
the cave-man, in astonishment; “but you will excuse
my saying that you are now 8,000 <i>li</i> out of your course.
This is the way to the country of the Poisonous Dragons,
and not your route at all.” He then went off to find a
boat for Piao, and, himself swimming in the water
behind, pushed it along like an arrow from a bow, so
quickly that by the next day they had traversed the
whole distance. On the shore Piao observed a young
man walking up and down and evidently watching him;
and, knowing that no human beings dwelt there, he
guessed at once that he was his brother. Approaching
more closely, he saw that he was right; and, seizing the
young man’s hand, he asked after his mother and sister.
On hearing that they were well, he would have gone
directly to see them; but the younger one begged him
not to do so, and ran away himself to fetch them. Meanwhile,
Piao turned to thank the cave-man who had
brought him there, but he, too, had disappeared. In a
few minutes his mother and sister arrived, and, on seeing
Piao, they could not restrain their tears. Piao then laid
his scheme before them, and when they said they feared
people would ill-treat them, he replied, “In China I
hold a high position, and people will not dare to shew
<span class="pagenum" title="i-406"><a id="Page_i-406"></a></span>
you disrespect.” Thus they determined to go. The
wind, however, was against them, and mother and son
were at a loss what to do, when suddenly the sail bellied
out towards the south, and a rustling sound was heard.
“Heaven helps us, my mother!” cried Piao, full of joy;
and, hurrying on board at once, in three days they had
reached their destination. As they landed the people
fled right and left in fear, Piao having divided his own
clothes amongst the party; and when they arrived at the
house, and his mother saw Hsü, she began to rate him
soundly for running away without her. Hsü hastened to
acknowledge his error, and then all the family and
servants were introduced to her, each one being in
mortal dread of such a singular personage. Piao now
bade his mother learn to talk Chinese, and gave her any
quantity of fine clothes and rich meats, to the infinite
delight of the old lady. She and her daughter both
dressed in man’s clothes, and by the end of a few
months were able to understand what was said to them.
The brother, named Pao [Leopard], and the sister, Yeh
[Night], were both clever enough, and immensely strong
into the bargain. Piao was ashamed that Pao could not
read, and set to work to teach him; and the youngster
was so quick that he learnt the sacred books<a id="Anchor-336" title="Go to Footnote 336" href="#Footnote-336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> and histories
by merely reading them once over. However, he
would not enter upon a literary career, loving better to
draw a strong bow or ride a spirited horse, and finally
<span class="pagenum" title="i-407"><a id="Page_i-407"></a></span>
taking the highest military degree. He married the
daughter of a post-captain; but his sister had some
trouble in getting a husband, because of her being the
child of a cave-woman. At length a serjeant, named
Yüan, who was under her brother’s command, was
forced to take her as his wife. She could draw a
hundred-catty bow, and shoot birds at a hundred paces
without ever missing. Whenever Yüan went to battle
she went with him; and his subsequent rise to high rank
was chiefly due to her. At thirty-four years of age Pao
got a command; and in his great battles his mother, clad
in armour and grasping a spear, would fight by his side,
to the terror of all their adversaries; and when he himself
received the dignity of an hereditary title, he memorialized
the Throne to grant his mother the title of
“lady.”</p>

<br/>
FOOT-BALL ON THE TUNG-T‘ING
LAKE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Wang Shih-hsiu</span> was a native of Lu-chou, and such
a lusty fellow that he could pick up a stone mortar.<a id="Anchor-337" title="Go to Footnote 337" href="#Footnote-337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
Father and son were both good foot-ball players; but
when the former was about forty years of age he was
drowned while crossing the Money Pool.<a id="Anchor-338" title="Go to Footnote 338" href="#Footnote-338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Some eight
or nine years later our hero happened to be on his way
to Hunan; and anchoring in the Tung-t‘ing lake,
<a id="tn_4">watched</a> the moon rising in the east and illuminating the
water into a bright sheet of light. While he was thus
engaged, lo! from out of the lake emerged five men,
bringing with them a large mat which they spread on the
surface of the water so as to cover about six yards
square. Wine and food were then arranged upon it, and
Wang heard the sound of the dishes knocking together,
but it was a dull, soft sound, not at all like that of
<span class="pagenum" title="i-409"><a id="Page_i-409"></a></span>
ordinary crockery. Three of the men sat down on the
mat and the other two waited upon them. One of the
former was dressed in yellow, the other two in white, and
each wore a black turban. Their demeanour as they sat
there side by side was grave and dignified; in appearance
they resembled three of the ancients, but by
the fitful beams of the moon Wang was unable to see
very clearly what they were like. The attendants wore
black serge dresses, and one of them seemed to be a boy,
while the other was many years older. Wang now heard
the man in the yellow dress say, “This is truly a fine
moonlight night for a drinking-bout;” to which one of
his companions replied, “It quite reminds me of the
night when Prince Kuang-li feasted at Pear-blossom
Island.”<a id="Anchor-339" title="Go to Footnote 339" href="#Footnote-339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> The three then pledged each other in bumping
goblets, talking all the time in such a low tone that
Wang could not hear what they were saying. The boatmen
kept themselves concealed, crouching down at the
bottom of the boat; but Wang looked hard at the attendants,
the elder of whom bore a striking resemblance
to his father, though he spoke in quite a different tone of
voice. When it was drawing towards midnight, one of
them proposed a game at ball; and in a moment the
boy disappeared in the water, to return immediately with
a huge ball&mdash;quite an armful in fact&mdash;apparently full of
quicksilver, and lustrous within and without. All now
rose up, and the man in the yellow dress bade the old
<span class="pagenum" title="i-410"><a id="Page_i-410"></a></span>
attendant join them in the game. The ball was kicked
up some ten or fifteen feet in the air, and was quite
dazzling in its brilliancy; but once, when it had gone up
with a whish-h-h-h, it fell at some distance off, right in
the very middle of Wang’s boat. The occasion was
irresistible, and Wang, exerting all his strength, kicked
the ball with all his might. It seemed unusually light
and soft to the touch, and his foot broke right through.
Away went the ball to a good height, pouring forth a
stream of light like a rainbow from the hole Wang had
made, and making as it fell a curve like that of a comet
rushing across the sky. Down it glided into the water,
where it fizzed a moment and then went out. “Ho,
there!” cried out the players in anger, “what living
creature is that who dares thus to interrupt our sport?”
“Well kicked&mdash;indeed!” said the old man, “that’s a
favourite drop-kick of my own.” At this, one of the
two in white clothes began to abuse him saying, “What!
you old baggage, when we are all so annoyed in this
manner, are you to come forward and make a joke of
it? Go at once with the boy and bring back to us this
practical joker, or your own back will have a taste of the
stick.” Wang was of course unable to flee; however, he
was not a bit afraid, and grasping a sword stood there in
the middle of the boat. In a moment, the old man and
boy arrived, also armed, and then Wang knew that the
former was really his father, and called out to him at
once, “Father, I am your son.” The old man was
greatly alarmed, but father and son forgot their troubles
in the joy of meeting once again. Meanwhile, the boy
<span class="pagenum" title="i-411"><a id="Page_i-411"></a></span>
went back, and Wang’s father <a id="tn_5">bade</a> him hide, or they
would all be lost. The words were hardly out of his
mouth when the three men jumped on board the boat.
Their faces were black as pitch, their eyes as big as
pomegranates, and they at once proceeded to seize the
old man. Wang struggled hard with them, and
managing to get the boat free from her moorings, he
seized his sword and cut off one of his adversaries’
arms. The arm dropped down and the man in the
yellow dress ran away; whereupon one of those in white
rushed at Wang who immediately cut off his head, and
he fell into the water with a splash, at which the third
disappeared. Wang and his father were now anxious to
get away, when suddenly a great mouth arose from the
lake, as big and as deep as a well, and against which
they could hear the noise of the water when it struck.
This mouth blew forth a violent gust of wind, and in a
moment the waves were mountains high and all the boats
on the lake were tossing about. The boatmen were
terrified, but Wang seized one of two huge stones there
were on board for use as anchors,<a id="Anchor-340" title="Go to Footnote 340" href="#Footnote-340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> about 130 lbs. in
weight, and threw it into the water, which immediately
began to subside; and then he threw in the other one,
upon which the wind dropped, and the lake became
calm again. Wang thought his father was a disembodied
spirit, but the old man said, “I never died. There
<span class="pagenum" title="i-412"><a id="Page_i-412"></a></span>
were nineteen of us drowned in the river, all of whom
were eaten by the fish-goblins except myself: I was
saved because I could play foot-ball. Those you saw
got into trouble with the Dragon King, and were sent
here. They were all marine creatures, and the ball they
were playing with was a fish-bladder.” Father and son
were overjoyed at meeting again, and at once proceeded
on their way. In the morning they found in the boat
a huge fin&mdash;the arm that Wang had cut off the night
before.</p>

<h2><a id="chapter-59"><abbr title="Fifty-Nine">LIX.</abbr>
<br/>
THE THUNDER GOD.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Lê Yün-hao</span> and Hsia P‘ing-tzŭ lived as boys in the
same village, and when they grew up read with the same
tutor, becoming the firmest of friends. Hsia was a clever
fellow, and had acquired some reputation even at the
early age of ten. Lê was not a bit envious, but rather
looked up to him, and Hsia in return helped his friend
very much with his studies, so that he, too, made considerable
progress. This increased Hsia’s fame, though
try as he would he could never succeed at the public
examinations, and by-and-by he sickened and died. His
family was so poor they could not find money for his
burial, whereupon Lê came forward and paid all expenses,
besides taking care of his widow and children.</p>

<p>Every peck or bushel he would share with them, the
widow trusting entirely to his support; and thus he
acquired a good name in the village, though not being a
rich man himself he soon ran through all his own property.
“Alas!” cried he, “where talents like Hsia’s
failed, can I expect to succeed? Wealth and rank are
matters of destiny, and my present career will only end
by my dying like a dog in a ditch. I must try something
<span class="pagenum" title="i-414"><a id="Page_i-414"></a></span>
else.” So he gave up book-learning and went into
trade, and in six months he had a trifle of money in
hand.</p>

<p>One day when he was resting at an inn in Nanking,
he saw a great big fellow walk in and seat himself at no
great distance in a very melancholy mood. Lê asked
him if he was hungry, and on receiving no answer,
pushed some food over towards him. The stranger immediately
set to feeding himself by handfuls, and in no
time the whole had disappeared. Lê ordered another
supply, but that was quickly disposed of in like manner;
and then he told the landlord to bring a shoulder of
pork and a quantity of boiled dumplings. Thus, after
eating enough for half a dozen, his appetite was appeased
and he turned to thank his benefactor, saying,
“For three years I haven’t had such a meal.” “And
why should a fine fellow like you be in such a state of
destitution?” inquired Lê; to which the other only
replied, “The judgments of heaven may not be discussed.”
Being asked where he lived, the stranger
replied, “On land I have no home, on the water no
boat; at dawn in the village, at night in the city.” Lê
then prepared to depart; but his friend would not leave
him, declaring that he was in imminent danger, and that
he could not forget the late kindness Lê had shewn him.
So they went along together, and on the way Lê invited
the other to eat with him; but this he refused, saying
that he only took food occasionally. Lê marvelled
more than ever at this; and next day when they were on
the river a great storm arose and capsized all their boats,
<span class="pagenum" title="i-415"><a id="Page_i-415"></a></span>
Lê himself being thrown into the water with the others.
Suddenly the gale abated and the stranger bore Lê on
his back to another boat, plunging at once into the
water and bringing back the lost vessel, upon which he
placed Lê and bade him remain quietly there. He then
returned once more, this time carrying in his arms a
part of the cargo, which he replaced in the vessel, and
so he went on until it was all restored. Lê thanked
him, saying, “It was enough to save my life; but you
have added to this the restoration of my goods.”
Nothing, in fact, had been lost, and now Lê began to
regard the stranger as something more than human.
The latter here wished to take his leave, but Lê pressed
him so much to stay that at last he consented to remain.
Then Lê remarked that after all he had lost a gold pin,
and immediately the stranger plunged into the water
again, rising at length to the surface with the missing
article in his mouth, and presenting it to Lê with the remark
that he was delighted to be able to fulfil his commands.
The people on the river were all much
astonished at what they saw; meanwhile Lê went home
with his friend, and there they lived together, the big
man only eating once in ten or twelve days, but then
displaying an enormous appetite. One day he spoke of
going away, to which Lê would by no means consent;
and as it was just then about to rain and thunder, he
asked him to tell him what the clouds were like, and
what thunder was, also how he could get up to the
sky and have a look, so as to set his mind at rest on the
subject. “Would you like to have a ramble among the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-416"><a id="Page_i-416"></a></span>
clouds?” asked the stranger, as Lê was lying down to
take a nap; on awaking from which he felt himself spinning
along through the air, and not at all as if he was
lying on a bed. Opening his eyes he saw he was among
the clouds, and around him was a fleecy atmosphere.
Jumping up in great alarm, he felt giddy as if he had
been at sea, and underneath his feet he found a soft,
yielding substance, unlike the earth. Above him were
the stars, and this made him think he was dreaming;
but looking up he saw that they were set in the sky like
seeds in the cup of a lily, varying from the size of the
biggest bowl to that of a small basin. On raising his
hand he discovered that the large stars were all tightly
fixed; but he managed to pick a small one, which he
concealed in his sleeve; and then, parting the clouds
beneath him, he looked through and saw the sea glittering
like silver below. Large cities appeared no bigger
than beans&mdash;just at this moment, however, he bethought
himself that if his foot were to slip, what a tremendous
fall he would have. He now beheld two dragons
writhing their way along, and drawing a cart with a huge
vat in it, each movement of their tails sounding like the
crack of a bullock-driver’s whip. The vat was full of
water, and numbers of men were employed in ladling it
out and sprinkling it on the clouds. These men were
astonished at seeing Lê; however, a big fellow among
them called out, “All right, he’s my friend,” and then
they gave him a ladle to help them throw the water out.
Now it happened to be a very dry season, and when Lê
got hold of the ladle he took good care to throw the
<span class="pagenum" title="i-417"><a id="Page_i-417"></a></span>
water so that it should all fall on and around his own
home. The stranger then told him that he was the God
of Thunder,<a id="Anchor-341" title="Go to Footnote 341" href="#Footnote-341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> and that he had just returned from a three
years’ punishment inflicted on him in consequence of
some neglect of his in the matter of rain. He added
that they must now part; and taking the long rope which
had been used as reins for the cart, bade Lê grip it
tightly, that he might be let down to earth. Lê was
afraid of this, but on being told there was no danger he
did so, and in a moment whish-h-h-h-h&mdash;away he went
and found himself safe and sound on <i xml:lang="la">terra firma</i>. He
discovered that he had descended outside his native
village, and then the rope was drawn up into the clouds
and he saw it no more. The drought had been excessive;
for three or four miles round very little rain had
fallen, though in Lê’s own village the water-courses were
all full. On reaching home he took the star out of his
sleeve, and put it on the table. It was dull-looking like
an ordinary stone; but at night it became very brilliant
and lighted up the whole house. This made him value
it highly, and he stored it carefully away, bringing it out
only when he had guests, to light them at their wine. It
was always thus dazzlingly bright, until one evening when
his wife was sitting with him doing her hair, the star
<span class="pagenum" title="i-418"><a id="Page_i-418"></a></span>
began to diminish in brilliancy, and to flit about like a
fire-fly. Mrs. Lê sat gaping with astonishment, when all
of a sudden it flitted into her mouth and ran down her
throat. She tried to cough it up but couldn’t, to the
very great amazement of her husband. That night Lê
dreamt that his old friend Hsia appeared before him and
said, “I am the Shao-wei star. Your friendship is still
cherished by me, and now you have brought me back
from the sky. Truly our destinies are knitted together,
and I will repay your kindness by becoming your son.”
Now Lê was thirty years of age but without sons; however,
after this dream his wife bore him a male child,
and they called his name Star. He was extraordinarily
clever, and at sixteen years of age took his master’s
degree.</p>

<br/>
THE GAMBLER’S TALISMAN.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A Taoist</span> priest, called Han, lived at the T‘ien-ch‘i
temple, in our district city. His knowledge of the black
art was very extensive, and the neighbours all regarded
him as an Immortal.<a id="Anchor-342" title="Go to Footnote 342" href="#Footnote-342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> My late father was on intimate
terms with him, and whenever he went into the city
invariably paid him a visit. One day, on such an
occasion, he was proceeding thither in company with
my late uncle, when suddenly they met Han on the
road. Handing them the key of the door, he begged
them to go on and wait awhile for him, promising to
be there shortly himself. Following out these instructions
they repaired to the temple, but on unlocking the
door there was Han sitting inside&mdash;a feat which he
subsequently performed several times.</p>

<p>Now a relative of mine, who was terribly given to
gambling, also knew this priest, having been introduced
to him by my father. And once this relative, meeting
with a Buddhist priest from the T‘ien-fo temple, addicted
<span class="pagenum" title="i-420"><a id="Page_i-420"></a></span>
like himself to the vice of gambling, played
with him until he had lost everything, even going so far
as to pledge the whole of his property, which he lost in
a single night. Happening to call in upon Han as he
was going back, the latter noticed his exceedingly dejected
appearance, and the rambling answers he gave,
and asked him what was the matter. On hearing the
story of his losses, Han only laughed, and said, “That’s
what always overtakes the gambler, sooner or later; if,
however, you will break yourself of the habit, I will get
your money back for you.” “Ah,” cried the other,
“if you will only do that, you may break my head with
a pestle when you catch me gambling again.” So
Han gave him a talismanic formula, written out on a
piece of paper, to put in his girdle, bidding him only
win back what he had lost, and not attempt to get a
fraction more. He also handed him 1000 <i>cash</i>, on
condition that this sum should be repaid from his
winnings, and off went my relative delighted. The
Buddhist, however, turned up his nose at the smallness
of his means, and said it wasn’t worth his while to
stake so little; but at last he was persuaded into
having one throw for the whole lot. They then began,
the priest leading off with a fair throw, to which his
opponent replied by a better; whereupon the priest
doubled his stake, and my relative won again, going on
and on until the latter’s good luck had brought him
back all that he had previously lost. He thought,
however, that he couldn’t do better than just win a
few more strings of cash, and accordingly went on;
<span class="pagenum" title="i-421"><a id="Page_i-421"></a></span>
but gradually his luck turned, and on looking into his
girdle he found that the talisman was gone. In a great
fright he jumped up, and went off with his winnings to
the temple, where he reckoned up that after deducting
Han’s loan, and adding what he had lost towards the
end, he had exactly the amount originally his. With
shame in his face he turned to thank Han, mentioning
at the same time the loss of the talisman; at which
Han only laughed, and said, “That has got back before
you. I told you not to be over-greedy, and as you
didn’t heed me, I took the talisman away.”<a id="Anchor-343" title="Go to Footnote 343" href="#Footnote-343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<br/>
THE HUSBAND PUNISHED.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Ching Hsing</span>, of Wên-têng, was a young fellow of
some literary reputation, who lived next door to a Mr.
Ch‘ên, their studios being separated only by a low wall.
One evening Ch‘ên was crossing a piece of waste ground
when he heard a young girl crying among some pine-trees
hard by. He approached, and saw a girdle hanging
from one of the branches, as if its owner was just
on the point of hanging herself. Ch‘ên asked her
what was the matter, and then she brushed away her
tears, and said, “My mother has gone away and left
me in charge of my brother-in-law; but he’s a scamp,
and won’t continue to take care of me; and now there
is nothing left for me but to die.” Hereupon the girl
began crying again, and Ch‘ên untied the girdle and
bade her go and find herself a husband; to which she
said there was very little chance of that; and then
Ch‘ên offered to take her to his own home&mdash;an offer
which she very gladly accepted. Soon after they
arrived, his neighbour Ching thought he heard a
noise, and jumped over the wall to have a peep, when
lo and behold! at the door of Ch‘ên’s house stood
<span class="pagenum" title="i-423"><a id="Page_i-423"></a></span>
this young lady, who immediately ran away into the
garden on seeing Ching. The two young men pursued
her, but without success, and were obliged to return
each to his own room, Ching being greatly astonished
to find the same girl now standing at his door. On
addressing the young lady, she told him that his neighbour’s
destiny was too poor a one for her,<a id="Anchor-344" title="Go to Footnote 344" href="#Footnote-344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> and that she
came from Shantung, and that her name was Ch‘i
A-hsia. She finally agreed to take up her residence
with Ching; but after a few days, finding that a great
number of his friends were constantly calling, she
declared it was too noisy a place for her, and that she
would only visit him in the evening. This she continued
to do for a few days, telling him in reply to his
inquiries that her home was not very far off. One
evening, however, she remarked that their present <i>liaison</i>
was not very creditable to either; that her father was a
mandarin on the western frontier, and that she was
about to set out with her mother to join him; begging
him meanwhile to make a formal request for the celebration
of their nuptials, in order to prevent them from
being thus separated. She further said that they started
in ten days or so, and then Ching began to reflect that
if he married her she would have to take her place in the
family, and that would make his first wife jealous; so
he determined to get rid of the latter, and when she
came in he began to abuse her right and left. His wife
<span class="pagenum" title="i-424"><a id="Page_i-424"></a></span>
bore it as long as she could, but at length cried out it
were better she should die; upon which Ching advised
her not to bring trouble on them all like that, but to go
back to her own home. He then drove her away, his
wife asking all the time what she had done to be sent
away like this after ten years of blameless life with
him.<a id="Anchor-345" title="Go to Footnote 345" href="#Footnote-345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Ching, however, paid no heed to her entreaties,
and when he had got rid of her he set to work at once
to get the house whitewashed and made generally clean,
himself being on the tip-toe of expectation for the
arrival of Miss A-hsia. But he waited and waited, and
no A-hsia came; she seemed gone like a stone dropped
into the sea. Meanwhile emissaries came from his late
wife’s family begging him to take her back; and when
he flatly refused, she married a gentleman of position
named Hsia, whose property adjoined Ching’s, and who
had long been at feud with him in consequence, as is
usual in such cases. This made Ching furious, but he
still hoped that A-hsia would come, and tried to console
himself in this way. Yet more than a year passed
away and still no signs of her, until one day, at the
festival of the Sea Spirits, he saw among the crowds of
girls passing in and out one who very much resembled
A-hsia. Ching moved towards her, following her as she
threaded her way through the crowd as far as the temple
gate, where he lost sight of her altogether, to his great
mortification and regret. Another six months passed
<span class="pagenum" title="i-425"><a id="Page_i-425"></a></span>
away, when one day he met a young lady dressed in
red, accompanied by an old man-servant, and riding on
a black mule. It was A-hsia. So he asked the old
man the name of his young mistress, and learnt from
him that she was the second wife of a gentleman named
Chêng, having been married to him about a fortnight
previously. Ching now thought she could not be A-hsia,
but just then the young lady, hearing them talking,
turned her head, and Ching saw that he was right.
And now, finding that she had actually married another
man, he was overwhelmed with rage, and cried out in a
loud voice, “A-hsia! A-hsia! why did you break
faith?” The servant here objected to his mistress
being thus addressed by a stranger, and was squaring
up to Ching, when A-hsia bade him desist; and, raising
her veil, replied, “And you, faithless one, how do you
dare meet my gaze?” “You are the faithless one,”
said Ching, “not I.” “To be faithless to your wife is
worse than being faithless to me,” rejoined A-hsia; “if
you behaved like that to her, how should I have been
treated at your hands? Because of the fair fame of
your ancestors, and the honours gained by them, I was
willing to ally myself with you; but now that you have
discarded your wife, your thread of official advancement
has been cut short in the realms below, and Mr. Ch‘ên is
to take the place that should have been yours at the head
of the examination list. As for myself, I am now part of
the Chêng family; think no more of me.” Ching hung
his head and could make no reply; and A-hsia whipped
up her mule and disappeared from his sight, leaving him
<span class="pagenum" title="i-426"><a id="Page_i-426"></a></span>
to return home disconsolate. At the forthcoming examination,
everything turned out as she had predicted;
Mr. Ch‘ên was at the top of the list, and he himself
was thrown out. It was clear that his luck was gone.
At forty he had no wife, and was so poor that he was
glad to pick up a meal where he could. One day he
called on Mr. Chêng, who treated him well and kept
him there for the night; and while there Chêng’s second
wife saw him, and asked her husband if his guest’s name
wasn’t Ching. “It is,” said he, “how could you guess
that?” “Well,” replied she, “before I married you, I
took refuge in his house, and he was then very kind to
me. Although he has now sunk low, yet his ancestors’
influence on the family fortunes is not yet exhausted;<a id="Anchor-346" title="Go to Footnote 346" href="#Footnote-346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
besides he is an old acquaintance of yours, and you
should try and do something for him.” Chêng consented,
and having first given him a new suit of clothes,
kept him in the house several days. At night a slave-girl
came to him with twenty ounces of silver for him,
and Mrs. Chêng, who was outside the window, said,
“This is a trifling return for your past kindness to me.
Go and get yourself a good wife. The family luck is
not yet exhausted, but will descend to your sons and
<span class="pagenum" title="i-427"><a id="Page_i-427"></a></span>
grandchildren. Do not behave like this again, and so
shorten your term of life.” Ching thanked her and
went home, using ten ounces of silver to procure a
concubine from a neighbouring family, who was very
ugly and ill-tempered. However, she bore him a son,
and he by-and-by graduated as doctor. Mr. Chêng
became Vice-President of the Board of Civil Office,<a id="Anchor-347" title="Go to Footnote 347" href="#Footnote-347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
and at his death A-hsia attended the funeral; but when
they opened her chair on its return home, she was gone,
and then people knew for the first time that she was not
mortal flesh and blood. Alas! for the perversity of
mankind, rejecting the old and craving for the new?<a id="Anchor-348" title="Go to Footnote 348" href="#Footnote-348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
And then when they come back to the familiar nest, the
birds have all flown. Thus does heaven punish such
people.</p>

<br/>
THE MARRIAGE LOTTERY.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> labourer’s son, named Ma T‘ien-jung, lost
his wife when he was only about twenty years of age, and
was too poor to take another. One day when out hoeing
in the fields, he beheld a nice-looking young lady leave
the path and come tripping across the furrows towards
him. Her face was well painted,<a id="Anchor-349" title="Go to Footnote 349" href="#Footnote-349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> and she had altogether
such a refined look that Ma concluded she must have
lost her way, and began to make some playful remarks
in consequence. “You go along home,” cried the
young lady, “and I’ll be with you by-and-by.” Ma
doubted this rather extraordinary promise, but she
vowed and declared she would not break her word;
and then Ma went off, telling her that his front door
faced the north, etc., etc. In the evening the young
lady arrived, and then Ma saw that her hands and face
were covered with fine hair, which made him suspect at
once she was a fox. She did not deny the accusation;
<span class="pagenum" title="i-429"><a id="Page_i-429"></a></span>
and accordingly Ma said to her, “If you really are one
of those wonderful creatures you will be able to get me
anything I want; and I should be much obliged if you
would begin by giving me some money to relieve my
poverty.” The young lady said she would; and next
evening when she came again, Ma asked her where the
money was. “Dear me!” replied she, “I quite forgot
it.” When she was going away, Ma reminded her of
what he wanted, but on the following evening she made
precisely the same excuse, promising to bring it another
day. A few nights afterwards Ma asked her once more
for the money, and then she drew from her sleeve two
pieces of silver, each weighing about five or six ounces.
They were both of fine quality, with turned-up edges,<a id="Anchor-350" title="Go to Footnote 350" href="#Footnote-350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
and Ma was very pleased and stored them away in a
cupboard. Some months after this, he happened to
require some money for use, and took out these pieces;
but the person to whom he showed them said they were
only pewter, and easily bit off a portion of one of them
with his teeth. Ma was much alarmed, and put the
pieces away directly; taking the opportunity when
evening came of abusing the young lady roundly.
“It’s all your bad luck,” retorted she; “real gold
would be too much for your inferior destiny.”<a id="Anchor-351" title="Go to Footnote 351" href="#Footnote-351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> There
was an end of that; but Ma went on to say, “I
<span class="pagenum" title="i-430"><a id="Page_i-430"></a></span>
always heard that fox-girls were of surpassing beauty;
how is it you are not?” “Oh,” replied the young lady,
“we always adapt ourselves to our company. Now you
haven’t the luck of an ounce of silver to call your
own; and what would you do, for instance, with a
beautiful princess?<a id="Anchor-352" title="Go to Footnote 352" href="#Footnote-352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> My beauty may not be good
enough for the aristocracy; but among your big-footed,
burden-carrying rustics,<a id="Anchor-353" title="Go to Footnote 353" href="#Footnote-353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> why it may safely be called
‘surpassing.’”</p>

<p>A few months passed away, and then one day the
young lady came and gave Ma three ounces of silver,
saying, “You have often asked me for money, but in
consequence of your weak luck I have always refrained
from giving you any. Now, however, your marriage is
at hand, and I here give you the cost of a wife, which
you may also regard as a parting gift from me.” Ma
replied that he wasn’t engaged, to which the young lady
answered that in a few days a go-between would visit
him to arrange the affair. “And what will she be
like?” asked Ma. “Why, as your aspirations are for
‘surpassing’ beauty,” replied the young lady, “of
course she will be possessed of surpassing beauty.”
“I hardly expect that,” said Ma; “at any rate three
ounces of silver will not be enough to get a wife.”
<span class="pagenum" title="i-431"><a id="Page_i-431"></a></span>
“Marriages,” explained the young lady, “are made in
the moon;<a id="Anchor-354" title="Go to Footnote 354" href="#Footnote-354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> mortals have nothing to do with them.”
“And why must you be going away like this?” inquired
Ma. “Because,” answered she, “we go on
shilly-shallying from day to day, and month to month,
and nothing ever comes of it. I had better get you
another wife and have done with you.” Then when
morning came, she departed, giving Ma a pinch of
yellow powder, saying, “In case you are ill after we
are separated, this will cure you.” Next day, sure
enough, a go-between did come, and Ma at once asked
what the proposed bride was like; to which the former
replied that she was very passable-looking. Four or
five ounces of silver was fixed as the marriage present,
Ma making no difficulty on that score, but declaring
he must have a peep at the young lady.<a id="Anchor-355" title="Go to Footnote 355" href="#Footnote-355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> The
go-between said she was a respectable girl, and would
<span class="pagenum" title="i-432"><a id="Page_i-432"></a></span>
never allow herself to be seen; however it was arranged
that they should go to the house together, and await
a good opportunity. So off they went, Ma remaining
outside while the go-between went in, returning in a
little while to tell him it was all right. “A relative
of mine lives in the same court, and just now I saw
the young lady sitting in the hall. We have only got
to pretend we are going to see my relative, and you
will be able to get a glimpse of her.” Ma consented,
and they accordingly passed through the hall, where he
saw the young lady sitting down with her head bent
forward while some one was scratching her back. She
seemed to be all that the go-between had said; but
when they came to discuss the money, it appeared the
young lady only wanted one or two ounces of silver,
just to buy herself a few clothes, etc., at which Ma was
delighted, and gave the go-between a present for her
trouble, which just finished up the three ounces his
fox-friend had provided. An auspicious day was chosen,
and the young lady came over to his house; when lo!
she was hump-backed and pigeon-breasted, with a short
neck like a tortoise, and boat-shaped feet, full ten inches
long. The meaning of his fox-friend’s remarks then
flashed upon him.</p>

THE LO-CH‘A COUNTRY AND THE
SEA-MARKET.</a><a id="Anchor-356" title="Go to Footnote 356" href="#Footnote-356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Once</span> upon a time there was a young man, named Ma
Chün, who was also known as Lung-mei. He was the
son of a trader, and a youth of surpassing beauty. His
manners were courteous, and he loved nothing better
than singing and playing. He used to associate with
actors, and with an embroidered handkerchief round his
head the effect was that of a beautiful woman. Hence
he acquired the sobriquet of the Beauty. At fourteen
years of age he graduated and began to make a name for
himself; but his father, who was growing old and wished
to retire from business, said to him, “My boy, book-learning
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-2"><a id="Page_ii-2"></a></span>
will never fill your belly or put a coat on your
back; you had much better stick to the old thing.”
Accordingly, Ma from that time occupied himself with
scales and weights, with principle and interest, and such
matters.</p>

<p>He made a voyage across the sea, and was carried
away by a typhoon. After being tossed about for many
days and nights he arrived at a country where the
people were hideously ugly. When these people saw
Ma they thought he was a devil and all ran screeching
away. Ma was somewhat alarmed at this, but finding
that it was they who were frightened at him, he quickly
turned their fear to his own advantage. If he came
across people eating and drinking he would rush upon
them, and when they fled away for fear, he would regale
himself upon what they had left. By-and-by he went to
a village among the hills, and there the people had at
any rate some facial resemblance to ordinary men. But
they were all in rags and tatters like beggars. So Ma
sat down to rest under a tree, and the villagers, not
daring to come near him, contented themselves with
looking at him from a distance. They soon found, however,
that he did not want to eat them, and by degrees
approached a little closer to him. Ma, smiling, began
to talk; and although their language was different, yet
he was able to make himself tolerably intelligible, and
told them whence he had come. The villagers were
much pleased, and spread the news that the stranger was
not a man-eater. Nevertheless, the very ugliest of all
would only take a look and be off again; they would
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-3"><a id="Page_ii-3"></a></span>
not come near him. Those who did go up to him were
not very much unlike his own countrymen, the Chinese.
They brought him plenty of food and wine. Ma asked
them what they were afraid of. They replied, “We had
heard from our forefathers that 26,000 <i>li</i> to the west
there is a country called China. We had heard that the
people of that land were the most extraordinary in appearance
you can possibly imagine. Hitherto it has
been hearsay; we can now believe it.” He then asked
them how it was they were so poor. They answered,
“You see, in our country everything depends, not on
literary talent, but on beauty. The most beautiful are
made ministers of state; the next handsomest are made
judges and magistrates; and the third class in looks are
employed in the palace of the king. Thus these are
enabled out of their pay to provide for their wives and
families. But we, from our very birth, are regarded by
our parents as inauspicious, and are left to perish, some
of us being occasionally preserved by more humane
parents to prevent the extinction of the family.” Ma
asked the name of their country, and they told him it
was Lo-ch‘a. Also that the capital city was some 30 <i>li</i>
to the north. He begged them to take him there, and
next day at cock-crow he started thitherwards in their
company, arriving just about dawn. The walls of the
city were made of black stone, as black as ink, and the
city gate-houses were about 100 feet high. Red stones
were used for tiles, and picking up a broken piece Ma
found that it marked his finger-nail like vermilion. They
arrived just when the Court was rising, and saw all the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-4"><a id="Page_ii-4"></a></span>
equipages of the officials. The village people pointed
out one who they said was Prime Minister. His ears
drooped forward in flaps; he had three nostrils, and his
eye-lashes were just like bamboo screens hanging in
front of his eyes. Then several came out on horseback,
and they said these were the privy councillors. So they
went on, telling him the rank of all the ugly uncouth
fellows he saw. The lower they got down in the official
scale the less hideous the officials were. By-and-by Ma
went back, the people in the streets marvelling very
much to see him, and tumbling helter-skelter one over
another as if they had met a goblin. The villagers
shouted out to re-assure them, and then they stood at a
distance to look at him. When he got back, there was
not a man, woman, or child in the whole nation but
knew that there was a strange man at the village; and
the gentry and officials became very desirous to see him.
However, if he went to any of their houses the porter
always slammed the door in his face, and the master,
mistress, and family, in general, would only peep at, and
speak to him through the cracks. Not a single one
dared receive him face to face; but, finally, the village
people, at a loss what to do, bethought themselves of a
man who had been sent by a former king on official
business among strange nations. “He,” said they,
“having seen many kinds of men, will not be afraid of
you.” So they went to his house, where they were
received in a very friendly way. He seemed to be about
eighty or ninety years of age; his eye-balls protruded,
and his beard curled up like a hedge-hog. He said,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-5"><a id="Page_ii-5"></a></span>
“In my youth I was sent by the king among many
nations, but I never went to China. I am now one
hundred and twenty years of age, and that I should be
permitted to see a native of your country is a fact which
it will be my duty to report to the Throne. For ten
years and more I have not been to Court, but have remained
here in seclusion; yet I will now make an effort
on your behalf.” Then followed a banquet, and when
the wine had already circulated pretty freely, some dozen
singing girls came in and sang and danced before them.
The girls all wore white embroidered turbans, and long
scarlet robes which trailed on the ground. The words
they uttered were unintelligible, and the tunes they
played perfectly hideous. The host, however, seemed to
enjoy it very much, and said to Ma, “Have you music in
China?” He replied that they had, and the old man
asked for a specimen. Ma hummed him a tune, beating
time on the table, with which he was very much pleased,
declaring that his guest had the voice of a phœnix and
the notes of a dragon, such as he had never heard
before. The next day he presented a memorial to the
Throne, and the king at once commanded Ma to appear
before him. Several of the ministers, however, represented
that his appearance was so hideous it might
frighten His Majesty, and the king accordingly desisted
from his intention. The old man returned and told Ma,
being quite upset about it. They remained together
some time until they had drunk themselves tipsy. Then
Ma, seizing a sword, began to attitudinize, smearing his
face all over with coal-dust. He acted the part of Chang
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-6"><a id="Page_ii-6"></a></span>
Fei,<a id="Anchor-357" title="Go to Footnote 357" href="#Footnote-357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> at which his host was so delighted that he begged
him to appear before the Prime Minister in the character
of Chang Fei. Ma replied, “I don’t mind a little
amateur acting, but how can I play the hypocrite<a id="Anchor-358" title="Go to Footnote 358" href="#Footnote-358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> for
my own personal advantage?” On being pressed he
consented, and the old man prepared a great feast, and
asked some of the high officials to be present, telling Ma
to paint himself as before. When the guests had
arrived, Ma was brought out to see them; whereupon
they all exclaimed, “Ai-yah! how is it he was so ugly
before and is now so beautiful?” By-and-by, when they
were all taking wine together, Ma began to sing them a
most bewitching song, and they got so excited over it
that next day they recommended him to the king. The
king sent a special summons for him to appear, and
asked him many questions about the government of
China, to all of which Ma replied in detail, eliciting sighs
of admiration from His Majesty. He was honoured
with a banquet in the royal guest-pavilion, and when the
king had made himself tipsy he said to him, “I hear you
are a very skilful musician. Will you be good enough to
let me hear you?” Ma then got up and began to
attitudinize, singing a plaintive air like the girls with the
turbans. The king was charmed, and at once made him
a privy councillor, giving him a private banquet, and bestowing
other marks of royal favour. As time went on
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-7"><a id="Page_ii-7"></a></span>
his fellow-officials found out the secret of his painted
face,<a id="Anchor-359" title="Go to Footnote 359" href="#Footnote-359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> and whenever he was among them they were
always whispering together, besides which they avoided
being near him as much as possible. Thus Ma was left
to himself, and found his position anything but pleasant
in consequence. So he memorialized the Throne, asking
to be allowed to retire from office, but his request was
refused. He then said his health was bad, and got three
months’ sick leave, during which he packed up his
valuables and went back to the village. The villagers on
his arrival went down on their knees to him, and he distributed
gold and jewels amongst his old friends. They
were very glad to see him, and said, “Your kindness
shall be repaid when we go to the sea-market; we will
bring you some pearls and things.” Ma asked them
where that was. They said it was at the bottom of the
sea, where the mermaids<a id="Anchor-360" title="Go to Footnote 360" href="#Footnote-360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> kept their treasures, and that
as many as twelve nations were accustomed to go thither
to trade. Also that it was frequented by spirits, and that
to get there it was necessary to pass through red vapours
and great waves. “Dear Sir,” they said, “do not yourself
risk this great danger, but let us take your money
and purchase these rare pearls for you. The season is
now at hand.” Ma asked them how they knew this.
They said, “Whenever we see red birds flying backwards
and forwards over the sea, we know that within seven
days the market will open.” He asked when they were
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-8"><a id="Page_ii-8"></a></span>
going to start, that he might accompany them; but they
begged him not to think of doing so. He replied, “I
am a sailor: how can I be afraid of wind and waves?”
Very soon after this people came with merchandise to
forward, and so Ma packed up and went on board the
vessel that was going.</p>

<p>This vessel held some tens of people, was flat-bottomed
with a railing all round, and, rowed by ten men, it cut
through the water like an arrow. After a voyage of
three days they saw afar off faint outlines of towers and
minarets, and crowds of trading vessels. They soon
arrived at the city, the walls of which were made of
bricks as long as a man’s body, the tops of its buildings
being lost in the Milky Way.<a id="Anchor-361" title="Go to Footnote 361" href="#Footnote-361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Having made fast their
boat they went in, and saw laid out in the market rare
pearls and wondrous precious stones of dazzling beauty,
such as are quite unknown amongst men. Then they
saw a young man come forth riding upon a beautiful
steed. The people of the market stood back to let him
pass, saying he was the third son of the king; but when
the Prince saw Ma, he exclaimed, “This is no foreigner,”
and immediately an attendant drew near and asked his
name and country. Ma made a bow, and standing at
one side told his name and family. The prince smiled,
and said, “For you to have honoured our country thus
is no small piece of good luck.” He then gave him a
horse and begged him to follow. They went out of the
city gate and down to the sea-shore, whereupon their
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-9"><a id="Page_ii-9"></a></span>
horses plunged into the water. Ma was terribly
frightened and screamed out; but the sea opened dry
before them and formed a wall of water on either side.
In a little time they reached the king’s palace, the beams
of which were made of tortoise-shell and the tiles of
fishes’ scales. The four walls were of crystal, and
dazzled the eye like mirrors. They got down off their
horses and went in, and Ma was introduced to the king.
The young prince said, “Sire, I have been to the
market, and have got a gentleman from China.” Whereupon
Ma made obeisance before the king, who addressed
him as follows:&mdash;“Sir, from a talented scholar
like yourself I venture to ask for a few stanzas upon our
sea-market. Pray do not refuse.” Ma thereupon made
a <i>kot‘ow</i> and undertook the king’s command. Using an
ink-slab of crystal, a brush of dragon’s beard, paper as
white as snow, and ink scented like the larkspur,<a id="Anchor-362" title="Go to Footnote 362" href="#Footnote-362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Ma
immediately threw off some thousand odd verses, which
he laid at the feet of the king. When His Majesty saw
them, he said, “Sir, your genius does honour to these
marine nations of ours.” Then, summoning the members
of the royal family, the king gave a great feast in the
Coloured Cloud pavilion; and, when the wine had
circulated freely, seizing a great goblet in his hand, the
king rose and said before all the guests, “It is a thousand
pities, Sir, that you are not married. What say you to
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-10"><a id="Page_ii-10"></a></span>
entering the bonds of wedlock?” Ma rose blushing,
and stammered out his thanks; upon which the king
looking round spoke a few words to the attendants, and
in a few moments in came a bevy of court ladies supporting
the king’s daughter, whose ornaments went
tinkle, tinkle, as she walked along. Immediately the
nuptial drums and trumpets began to sound forth, and
bride and bridegroom worshipped Heaven and Earth together.<a id="Anchor-363" title="Go to Footnote 363" href="#Footnote-363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
Stealing a glance Ma saw that the princess was
endowed with a fairy-like loveliness. When the ceremony
was over she retired, and by-and-by the wine-party
broke up. Then came several beautifully-dressed
waiting-maids, who with painted candles escorted Ma
within. The bridal couch was made of coral adorned
with eight kinds of precious stones, and the curtains
were thickly hung with pearls as big as acorns. Next
day at dawn a crowd of young slave-girls trooped into
the room to offer their services; whereupon Ma got up
and went off to Court to pay his respects to the king.
He was then duly received as royal son-in-law and made
an officer of state. The fame of his poetical talents
spread far and wide, and the kings of the various seas
sent officers to congratulate him, vying with each other
in their invitations to him. Ma dressed himself in
gorgeous clothes, and went forth riding on a superb steed,
with a mounted body-guard all splendidly armed.
There were musicians on horseback and musicians in
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-11"><a id="Page_ii-11"></a></span>
chariots, and in three days he had visited every one
of the marine kingdoms, making his name known in
all directions. In the palace there was a jade tree,
about as big round as a man could clasp. Its roots
were as clear as glass, and up the middle ran, as it were,
a stick of pale yellow. The branches were the size of
one’s arm; the leaves like white jade, as thick as a
copper cash. The foliage was dense, and beneath its
shade the ladies of the palace were wont to sit and sing.
The flowers which covered the tree resembled grapes,
and if a single petal fell to the earth it made a ringing
sound. Taking one up, it would be found to be exactly
like carved cornelian, very bright and pretty to look at.
From time to time a wonderful bird came and sang
there. Its feathers were of a golden hue, and its tail as
long as its body. Its notes were like the tinkling of
jade, very plaintive and touching to listen to. When Ma
heard this bird sing, it called up in him recollections of
his old home, and accordingly he said to the princess,
“I have now been away from my own country for three
years, separated from my father and mother. Thinking
of them my tears flow and the perspiration runs down
my back. Can you return with me?” His wife replied,
“The way of immortals is not that of men. I am
unable to do what you ask, but I cannot allow the feelings
of husband and wife to break the tie of parent and
child. Let us devise some plan.” When Ma heard this
he wept bitterly, and the princess sighed and said, “We
cannot both stay or both go.” The next day the king
said to him, “I hear that you are pining after your old
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-12"><a id="Page_ii-12"></a></span>
home. Will to-morrow suit you for taking leave?” Ma
thanked the king for his great kindness, which he declared
he could never forget, and promised to return
very shortly. That evening the princess and Ma talked
over their wine of their approaching separation. Ma
said they would soon meet again; but his wife averred
that their married life was at an end. Then he wept
afresh, but the princess said, “Like a filial son you are
going home to your parents. In the meetings and
separations of this life, a hundred years seem but a
single day; why, then, should we give way to tears like
children? I will be true to you; do you be faithful to
me; and then, though separated, we shall be united in
spirit, a happy pair. Is it necessary to live side by side in
order to grow old together? If you break our contract
your next marriage will not be a propitious one; but if
loneliness<a id="Anchor-364" title="Go to Footnote 364" href="#Footnote-364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> overtakes you then choose a concubine.
There is one point more of which I would speak, with
reference to our married life. I am about to become a
mother, and I pray you give me a name for your child.”
To this Ma replied, “If a girl I would have her called
Lung-kung; if a boy, then name him Fu-hai.”<a id="Anchor-365" title="Go to Footnote 365" href="#Footnote-365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> The
princess asked for some token of remembrance, and Ma
gave her a pair of jade lilies that he had got during his
stay in the marine kingdom. She added, “On the 8th
of the 4th moon, three years hence, when you once
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-13"><a id="Page_ii-13"></a></span>
more steer your course for this country, I will give you
up your child.” She next packed a leather bag full of
jewels and handed it to Ma, saying, “Take care of this;
it will be a provision for many generations.” When the
day began to break a splendid farewell feast was given him
by the king, and Ma bade them all adieu. The princess,
in a car drawn by snow-white sheep, escorted him to the
boundary of the marine kingdom, where he dismounted
and stepped ashore. “Farewell!” cried the princess, as
her returning car bore her rapidly away, and the sea,
closing over her, snatched her from her husband’s sight.
Ma returned to his home across the ocean. Some had
thought him long since dead and gone; all marvelled at
his story. Happily his father and mother were yet alive,
though his former wife had married another man; and
so he understood why the princess had pledged him to
constancy, for she already knew that this had taken
place. His father wished him to take another wife, but
he would not. He only took a concubine. Then, after
the three years had passed away, he started across the
sea on his return journey, when lo! he beheld, riding on
the wave-crests and splashing about the water in playing,
two young children. On going near, one of them seized
hold of him and sprung into his arms; upon which the
elder cried until he, too, was taken up. They were a boy
and girl, both very lovely, and wearing embroidered caps
adorned with jade lilies. On the back of one of them
was a worked case, in which Ma found the following
<span class="nowrap">letter:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I presume my father and mother-in-law are well.
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-14"><a id="Page_ii-14"></a></span>
Three years have passed away and destiny still keeps us
apart. Across the great ocean, the letter-bird would find
no path.<a id="Anchor-366" title="Go to Footnote 366" href="#Footnote-366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> I have been with you in my dreams until I
am quite worn out. Does the blue sky look down upon
any grief like mine? Yet Ch‘ang-ngo<a id="Anchor-367" title="Go to Footnote 367" href="#Footnote-367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> lives solitary in
the moon, and Chih Nü<a id="Anchor-368" title="Go to Footnote 368" href="#Footnote-368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> laments that she cannot cross
the Silver River. Who am I that I should expect happiness
to be mine? Truly this thought turns my tears
into joy. Two months after your departure I had twins,
who can already prattle away in the language of childhood,
at one moment snatching a date, at another a
pear. Had they no mother they would still live. These
I now send to you, with the jade lilies you gave me in
their hats, in token of the sender. When you take them
upon your knee, think that I am standing by your side.
I know that you have kept your promise to me, and I
am happy. I shall take no second husband, even unto
death. All thoughts of dress and finery are gone from
me; my looking-glass sees no new fashions; my face has
long been unpowdered, my eyebrows unblacked. You
are my Ulysses, I am your Penelope;<a id="Anchor-369" title="Go to Footnote 369" href="#Footnote-369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> though not
actually leading a married life, how can it be said that
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-15"><a id="Page_ii-15"></a></span>
we are not husband and wife. Your father and mother
will take their grandchildren upon their knees, though
they have never set eyes upon the bride. Alas! there is
something wrong in this. Next year your mother will
enter upon the long night. I shall be there by the side
of the grave as is becoming in her daughter-in-law.
From this time forth our daughter will be well; later on
she will be able to grasp her mother’s hand. Our boy,
when he grows up, may possibly be able to come to and
fro. Adieu, dear husband, adieu, though I am leaving
much unsaid.” Ma read the letter over and over again,
his tears flowing all the time. His two children clung
round his neck, and begged him to take them home.
“Ah, my children,” said he, “where is your home?”
Then they all wept bitterly, and Ma, looking at the great
ocean stretching away to meet the sky, lovely and pathless,
embraced his children, and proceeded sorrowfully to
return. Knowing, too, that his mother could not last
long, he prepared everything necessary for the ceremony
of interment, and planted a hundred young pine-trees at
her grave.<a id="Anchor-370" title="Go to Footnote 370" href="#Footnote-370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> The following year the old lady did die,
and her coffin was borne to its last resting-place, when
lo! there was the princess standing by the side of the
grave. The lookers-on were much alarmed, but in a
moment there was a flash of lightning, followed by a
clap of thunder and a squall of rain, and she was gone.
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-16"><a id="Page_ii-16"></a></span>
It was then noticed that many of the young pine-trees
which had died were one and all brought to life. Subsequently,
Fu-hai went in search of the mother for
whom he pined so much, and after some days’ absence
returned. Lung-kung, being a girl, could not accompany
him, but she mourned much in secret. One dark
day her mother entered and bid her dry her eyes, saying,
“My child, you must get married. Why these tears?”
She then gave her a tree of coral eight feet in height,
some Baroos camphor,<a id="Anchor-371" title="Go to Footnote 371" href="#Footnote-371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> one hundred valuable pearls,
and two boxes inlaid with gold and precious stones, as
her dowry. Ma having found out she was there, rushed
in and seizing her hand began to weep for joy, when
suddenly a violent peal of thunder rent the building, and
the princess had vanished.</p>

<br/>
THE FIGHTING CRICKET.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">During</span> the reign of Hsüan Tê,<a id="Anchor-372" title="Go to Footnote 372" href="#Footnote-372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> cricket fighting was
very much in vogue at court, levies of crickets being
exacted from the people as a tax. On one occasion the
magistrate of Hua-yin, wishing to make friends with
the Governor, presented him with a cricket which, on
being set to fight, displayed very remarkable powers; so
much so that the Governor commanded the magistrate
to supply him regularly with these insects. The latter, in
his turn, ordered the beadles of his district to provide
him with crickets; and then it became a practice for
people who had nothing else to do to catch and rear
them for this purpose. Thus the price of crickets rose
very high; and when the beadle’s<a id="Anchor-373" title="Go to Footnote 373" href="#Footnote-373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> runners came to
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-18"><a id="Page_ii-18"></a></span>
exact even a single one, it was enough to ruin several
families.</p>

<p>Now in the village of which we are speaking there
lived a man named Ch‘êng, a student who had often
failed for his bachelor’s degree; and, being a stupid sort
of fellow, his name was sent in for the post of beadle.
He did all he could to get out of it, but without
success; and by the end of the year his small patrimony
was gone. Just then came a call for crickets, and
Ch‘êng, not daring to make a like call upon his neighbours,
was at his wits’ end, and in his distress determined
to commit suicide. “What’s the use of that?” cried his
wife. “You’d do better to go out and try to find some.”
So off went Ch‘êng in the early morning, with a bamboo
tube and a silk net, not returning till late at night; and
he searched about in tumble-down walls, in bushes,
under stones, and in holes, but without catching more
than two or three, do what he would. Even those he
did catch were weak creatures, and of no use at all,
which made the magistrate fix a limit of time, the result
of which was that in a few days Ch‘êng got one hundred
blows with the bamboo. This made him so sore that he
was quite unable to go after the crickets any more, and,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-19"><a id="Page_ii-19"></a></span>
as he lay tossing and turning on the bed, he determined
once again to put an end to his life.</p>

<p>About that time a hump-backed fortune-teller of great
skill arrived at the village, and Ch‘êng’s wife, putting together
a trifle of money, went off to seek his assistance.
The door was literally blocked up&mdash;fair young girls and
white-headed dames crowding in from all quarters. A
room was darkened, and a bamboo screen hung at the
door, an altar being arranged outside at which the
fortune-seekers burnt incense in a brazier, and prostrated
themselves twice, while the soothsayer stood by the side,
and, looking up into vacancy, prayed for a response. His
lips opened and shut, but nobody heard what he said, all
standing there in awe waiting for the answer. In a few
moments a piece of paper was thrown from behind the
screen, and the soothsayer said that the petitioner’s desire
would be accomplished in the way he wished.
Ch‘êng’s wife now advanced, and, placing some money
on the altar, burnt her incense and prostrated herself in
a similar manner. In a few moments the screen began
to move, and a piece of paper was thrown down, on
which there were no words, but only a picture. In the
middle was a building like a temple, and behind this a
small hill, at the foot of which were a number <a id="tn_14">of</a> curious
stones, with the long, spiky feelers of innumerable
crickets appearing from behind. Hard by was a frog,
which seemed to be engaged in putting itself into various
kinds of attitudes. The good woman had no idea what
it all meant; but she noticed the crickets, and accordingly
went off home to tell her husband. “Ah,” said
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-20"><a id="Page_ii-20"></a></span>
he, “this is to shew me where to hunt for crickets;”
and, on looking closely at the picture, he saw that the
building very much resembled a temple to the east of their
village. So he forced himself to get up, and, leaning on
a stick, went out to seek crickets behind the temple.
Rounding an old grave, he came upon a place where
stones were lying scattered about as in the picture, and
then he set himself to watch attentively. He might as
well have been looking for a needle or a grain of mustard-seed;
and by degrees he became quite exhausted,
without finding anything, when suddenly an old frog
jumped out. Ch‘êng was a little startled, but immediately
pursued the frog, which retreated into the bushes.
He then saw one of the insects he wanted sitting at the
root of a bramble; but on making a grab at it, the
cricket ran into a hole, from which he was unable to
move it until he poured in some water, when out the
little creature came. It was a magnificent specimen,
strong and handsome, with a fine tail, green neck, and
golden wings; and, putting it in his basket, he returned
home in high glee to receive the congratulations of his
family. He would not have taken anything for this
cricket, and proceeded to feed it up carefully in a bowl.
Its belly was the colour of a crab’s, its back that of a
sweet chestnut; and Ch‘êng tended it most lovingly,
waiting for the time when the magistrate should call
upon him for a cricket.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a son of Ch‘êng’s, aged nine, one day
took the opportunity of his father being out to open the
bowl. Instantaneously the cricket made a spring forward
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-21"><a id="Page_ii-21"></a></span>
and was gone; and all efforts to catch it again
were unavailing. At length the boy made a grab at it
with his hand, but only succeeded in seizing one of its
legs, which thereupon broke, and the little creature soon
afterwards died. Ch‘êng’s wife turned deadly pale when
her son, with tears in his eyes, told her what had happened.
“Oh! won’t you catch it when your father
comes home,” said she; at which the boy ran away,
crying bitterly. Soon after Ch‘êng arrived, and when he
heard his wife’s story he felt as if he had been turned to
ice, and went in search of his son, who, however, was
nowhere to be found, until at length they discovered his
body lying at the bottom of a well. Their anger was
thus turned to grief, and death seemed as though it
would be a pleasant relief to them as they sat facing
each other in silence in their thatched and smokeless<a id="Anchor-374" title="Go to Footnote 374" href="#Footnote-374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
hut. At evening they prepared to bury the boy; but,
on touching the body, lo! he was still breathing. Overjoyed,
they placed him upon the bed, and towards the
middle of the night he came round; but a drop of
bitterness was mingled in his parents’ cup when they
found that his reason had fled. His father, however,
caught sight of the empty bowl in which he had kept
the cricket, and ceased to think any more about his son,
never once closing his eyes all night; and as day
gradually broke, there he lay stiff and stark, until
suddenly he heard the chirping of a cricket outside
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-22"><a id="Page_ii-22"></a></span>
the house door. Jumping up in a great hurry to see,
there was his lost insect; but, on trying to catch it,
away it hopped directly. At last he got it under his
hand, though, when he came to close his fingers on it,
there was nothing in them. So he went on, chasing it
up and down, until finally it hopped into a corner of the
wall; and then, looking carefully about, he espied it
once more, no longer the same in appearance, but small,
and of a dark red colour. Ch‘êng stood looking at it,
without trying to catch such a worthless specimen, when
all of a sudden the little creature hopped into his sleeve;
and, on examining it more nearly, he saw that it really
was a handsome insect, with well-formed head and neck,
and forthwith took it indoors. He was now anxious to try
its prowess; and it so happened that a young fellow of
the village, who had a fine cricket which used to win
every bout it fought, and was so valuable to him that he
wanted a high price for it, called on Ch‘êng that very
day. He laughed heartily at Ch‘êng’s champion, and,
producing his own, placed it side by side, to the great
disadvantage of the former. Ch‘êng’s countenance fell,
and he no longer wished to back his cricket; however,
the young fellow urged him, and he thought that there
was no use in rearing a feeble insect, and that he had
better sacrifice it for a laugh; so they put them together
in a bowl. The little cricket lay quite still like a piece
of wood, at which the young fellow roared again, and
louder than ever when it did not move even though
tickled with a pig’s bristle. By dint of tickling it was
roused at last, and then it fell upon its adversary with
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-23"><a id="Page_ii-23"></a></span>
such fury, that in a moment the young fellow’s cricket
would have been killed outright had not its master interfered
and stopped the fight. The little cricket then
stood up and chirped to Ch‘êng as a sign of victory; and
Ch‘êng, overjoyed, was just talking over the battle with
the young fellow, when a cock caught sight of the insect,
and ran up to eat it. Ch‘êng was in a great state of
alarm; but the cock luckily missed its aim, and the
cricket hopped away, its enemy pursuing at full speed.
In another moment it would have been snapped up,
when, lo! to his great astonishment, Ch‘êng saw his
cricket seated on the cock’s head, holding firmly on to
its comb. He then put it into a cage, and by-and-by
sent it to the magistrate, who, seeing what a small one
he had provided, was very angry indeed. Ch‘êng told
the story of the cock, which the magistrate refused to
believe, and set it to fight with other crickets, all of
which it vanquished without exception. He then tried it
with a cock, and as all turned out as Ch‘êng had said,
he gave him a present, and sent the cricket in to the
Governor. The Governor put it into a golden cage, and
forwarded it to the palace, accompanied by some remarks
on its performances; and when there, it was
found that of all the splendid collection of His Imperial
Majesty, not one was worthy to be placed alongside of
this one. It would dance in time to music, and thus
became a great favourite, the Emperor in return bestowing
magnificent gifts of horses and silks upon the
Governor. The Governor did not forget whence he had
obtained the cricket, and the magistrate also well rewarded
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-24"><a id="Page_ii-24"></a></span>
Ch‘êng by excusing him from the duties of
beadle, and by instructing the Literary Chancellor to
pass him for the first degree. A few months afterwards
Ch‘êng’s son recovered his intellect, and said that he had
been a cricket, and had proved himself a very skilful
fighter.<a id="Anchor-375" title="Go to Footnote 375" href="#Footnote-375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> The Governor, too, rewarded Ch‘êng handsomely,
and in a few years he was a rich man, with flocks,
and herds, and houses, and acres, quite one of the
wealthiest of mankind.</p>

<br/>
TAKING REVENGE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Hsiang Kao</span>, otherwise called Ch‘u-tan, was a
T‘ai-yüan man, and deeply attached to his half-brother
Shêng. Shêng himself was desperately enamoured of
a young lady named Po-ssŭ,<a id="Anchor-376" title="Go to Footnote 376" href="#Footnote-376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> who was also very fond
of him: but the mother wanted too much money for
her daughter. Now a rich young fellow named Chuang
thought he should like to get Po-ssŭ for himself, and
proposed to buy her as a concubine. “No, no,” said
Po-ssŭ to her mother, “I prefer being Shêng’s wife to
becoming Chuang’s concubine.” So her mother consented,
and informed Shêng, who had only recently
buried his first wife; at which he was delighted and
made preparations to take her over to his own house.
When Chuang heard this he was infuriated against
Shêng for thus depriving him of Po-ssŭ; and chancing
to meet him out one day, set to and abused him
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-26"><a id="Page_ii-26"></a></span>
roundly. Shêng answered him back, and then Chuang
ordered his attendants to fall upon Shêng and beat him
well, which they did, leaving him lifeless on the ground.
When Hsiang heard what had taken place he ran out
and found his brother lying dead upon the ground.
Overcome with grief, he proceeded to the magistrate’s,
and accused Chuang of murder; but the latter bribed
so heavily that nothing came of the accusation. This
worked Hsiang to frenzy, and he determined to assassinate
Chuang on the high road; with which intent he
daily concealed himself, with a sharp knife about him,
among the bushes on the hill-side, waiting for Chuang
to pass. By degrees, this plan of his became known
far and wide, and accordingly Chuang never went out
except with a strong body-guard, besides which he
engaged at a high price the services of a very skilful
archer, named Chiao T‘ung, so that Hsiang had no
means of carrying out his intention. However, he continued
to lie in wait day after day, and on one occasion
it began to rain heavily, and in a short time Hsiang
was wet through to the skin. Then the wind got up,
and a hailstorm followed, and by-and-by Hsiang was
quite numbed with the cold. On the top of the hill
there was a small temple wherein lived a Taoist priest,
whom Hsiang knew from the latter having occasionally
begged alms in the village, and to whom he had often
given a meal. This priest, seeing how wet he was,
gave him some other clothes, and told him to put
them on; but no sooner had he done so than he
crouched down like a dog, and found that he had
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-27"><a id="Page_ii-27"></a></span>
been changed into a tiger, and that the priest had
vanished. It now occurred to him to seize this
opportunity of revenging himself upon his enemy; and
away he went to his old ambush, where lo and behold!
he found his own body lying stiff and stark. Fearing
lest it should become food for birds of prey, he guarded
it carefully, until at length one day Chuang passed by.
Out rushed the tiger and sprung upon Chuang, biting
his head off, and swallowing it upon the spot; at which
Chiao T‘ung, the archer, turned round and shot the
animal through the heart. Just at that moment
Hsiang awaked as though from a dream, but it was
some time before he could crawl home, where he arrived
to the great delight of his family, who didn’t
know what had become of him. Hsiang said not a
word, lying quietly on the bed until some of his people
came in to congratulate him on the death of his great
enemy Chuang. Hsiang then cried out, “I was that
tiger,” and proceeded to relate the whole story, which
thus got about until it reached the ears of Chuang’s
son, who immediately set to work to bring his father’s
murderer to justice. The magistrate, however, did not
consider this wild story as sufficient evidence against
him, and thereupon dismissed the case.</p>

<br/>
THE TIPSY TURTLE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Lin-t‘iao there lived a Mr. Fêng, whose other
name the person who told me this story could not
remember; he belonged to a good family, though now
somewhat falling into decay. Now a certain man, who
caught turtles, owed him some money which he could
not pay, but whenever he captured any turtles he used
to send one to Mr. Fêng. One day he took him an
enormous creature, with a white spot on its forehead;
but Fêng was so struck with something in its appearance,
that he let it go again. A little while afterwards
he was returning home from his son-in-law’s,
and had reached the banks of the river,<a id="Anchor-377" title="Go to Footnote 377" href="#Footnote-377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> when in the
dusk of the evening he saw a drunken man come
rolling along, attended by two or three servants. No
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-29"><a id="Page_ii-29"></a></span>
sooner did he perceive Fêng than he called out, “Who
are you?” to which Fêng replied that he was a traveller.
“And haven’t you got a name?” shouted out
the drunken man in a rage, “that you must call yourself
a traveller?” To this Fêng made no reply, but
tried to pass by; whereupon he found himself seized
by the sleeve and unable to move. His adversary
smelt horribly of wine, and at length Fêng asked him,
saying, “And pray who are you?” “Oh, I am the
late magistrate at Nan-tu,” answered he; “what do
you want to know for?” “A nice disgrace to society
you are, too,” cried Fêng; “however, I am glad to
hear you are only <em>late</em> magistrate, for if you had been
present magistrate there would be bad times in store
for travellers.” This made the drunken man furious,
and he was proceeding to use violence, when Fêng
cried out, “My name is So-and-so, and I’m not the
man to stand this sort of thing from anybody.” No
sooner had he uttered these words than the drunken
man’s rage was turned into joy, and, falling on his
knees before Fêng, he said, “My benefactor! pray
excuse my rudeness.” Then getting up, he told his
servants to go on ahead and get something ready;
Fêng at first declining to go with him, but yielding on
being pressed. Taking his hand, the drunken man led
him along a short distance until they reached a village,
where there was a very nice house and grounds, quite
like the establishment of a person of position. As his
friend was now getting sober, Fêng inquired what
might be his name. “Don’t be frightened when I tell
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-30"><a id="Page_ii-30"></a></span>
you,” said the other; “I am the Eighth Prince of the
T‘iao river. I have just been out to take wine with
a friend, and somehow I got tipsy; hence my bad behaviour
to you, which please forgive.” Fêng now knew
that he was not of mortal flesh and blood; but, seeing
how kindly he himself was treated, he was not a bit afraid.
A banquet followed, with plenty of wine, of which the
Eighth Prince drank so freely that Fêng thought he
would soon be worse than ever, and accordingly said
he felt tipsy himself, and asked to be allowed to go to
bed. “Never fear,” answered the Prince, who perceived
Fêng’s thoughts; “many drunkards will tell you
that they cannot remember in the morning the extravagances
of the previous night, but I tell you this
is all nonsense, and that in nine cases out of ten
those extravagances are committed wittingly and with
malice prepense.<a id="Anchor-378" title="Go to Footnote 378" href="#Footnote-378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Now, though I am not the same
order of being as yourself, I should never venture to
behave badly in your good presence; so pray do not
leave me thus.” Fêng then sat down again and said
to the Prince, “Since you are aware of this, why not
change your ways?” “Ah,” replied the Prince, “when
I was a magistrate I drank much more than I do now;
but I got into disgrace with the Emperor and was
banished here, since which time, ten years and more, I
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-31"><a id="Page_ii-31"></a></span>
have tried to reform. Now, however, I am drawing
near the wood,<a id="Anchor-379" title="Go to Footnote 379" href="#Footnote-379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> and being unable to move about much,
the old vice has come upon me again; I have found it
impossible to stop myself, but perhaps what you say
may do me some good.” While they were thus talking,
the sound of a distant bell broke upon their ears; and
the Prince, getting up and seizing Fêng’s hand, said,
“We cannot remain together any longer; but I will give
you something by which I may in part requite your
kindness to me. It must not be kept for any great
length of time; when you have attained your wishes,
then I will receive it back again.” Thereupon he spit
out of his mouth a tiny man, no more than an inch
high, and scratching Fêng’s arm with his nails until Fêng
felt as if the skin was gone, he quickly laid the little
man upon the spot. When he let go, the latter had
already sunk into the skin, and nothing was to be seen
but a cicatrix well healed over. Fêng now asked what
it all meant, but the Prince only laughed, and said, “It’s
time for you to go,” and forthwith escorted him to the
door. The prince here bade him adieu, and when he
looked round, Prince, village, and house had all disappeared
together, leaving behind a great turtle which
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-32"><a id="Page_ii-32"></a></span>
waddled down into the water, and disappeared likewise.
He could now easily account for the Prince’s present to
him; and from this moment his sight became intensely
keen. He could see precious stones lying in the bowels
of the earth, and was able to look down as far as Hell
itself; besides which he suddenly found that he knew
the names of many things of which he had never heard
before. From below his own bedroom he dug up many
hundred ounces of pure silver, upon which he lived
very comfortably; and once when a house was for sale,
he perceived that in it lay concealed a vast quantity of
gold, so he immediately bought it, and so became immensely
rich in all kinds of valuables. He secured a
mirror, on the back of which was a phœnix, surrounded
by water and clouds, and portraits of the celebrated
wives of the Emperor Shun,<a id="Anchor-380" title="Go to Footnote 380" href="#Footnote-380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> so beautifully executed that
each hair of the head and eyebrows could easily be
counted. If any woman’s face came upon the mirror,
there it remained indelibly fixed and not to be rubbed
out; but if the same woman looked into the mirror
again, dressed in a different dress, or if some other
woman chanced to look in, then the former face would
gradually fade away.</p>

<p>Now the third princess in Prince Su’s family was very
beautiful; and Fêng, who had long heard of her fame,
concealed himself on the K‘ung-tung hill, when he knew
the Princess was going there. He waited until she
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-33"><a id="Page_ii-33"></a></span>
alighted from her chair, and then getting the mirror full
upon her, he walked off home. Laying it on the table,
he saw therein a lovely girl in the act of raising her
handkerchief, and with a sweet smile playing over her
face; her lips seemed about to move, and a twinkle was
discernible in her eyes.<a id="Anchor-381" title="Go to Footnote 381" href="#Footnote-381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> Delighted with this picture, he
put the mirror very carefully away; but in about a year
his wife had let the story leak out, and the Prince, hearing
of it, threw Fêng into prison, and took possession
of the mirror. Fêng was to be beheaded; however, he
bribed one of the Prince’s ladies to tell His Highness
that if he would pardon him all the treasures of the
earth might easily become his; whereas, on the other
hand, his death could not possibly be of any advantage
to the Prince. The Prince now thought of confiscating
all his goods and banishing him; but the third princess
observed, that as he had already seen her, were he to
die ten times over it would not give her back her lost
face, and that she had much better marry him. The
Prince would not hear of this, whereupon his daughter
shut herself up and refused all nourishment, at which
the ladies of the palace were dreadfully alarmed, and
reported it at once to the Prince. Fêng was accordingly
liberated, and was informed of the determination of the
Princess, which, however, he declined to fall in with,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-34"><a id="Page_ii-34"></a></span>
saying that he was not going thus to sacrifice the wife
of his days of poverty,<a id="Anchor-382" title="Go to Footnote 382" href="#Footnote-382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> and would rather die than
carry out such an order. He added that if His Highness
would consent, he would purchase his liberty at the
price of everything he had. The Prince was exceedingly
angry at this, and seized Fêng again; and meanwhile
one of the concubines got Fêng’s wife into the palace,
intending to poison her. Fêng’s wife, however, brought
her a beautiful present of a coral stand for a looking-glass,
and was so agreeable in her conversation, that the concubine
took a great fancy to her, and presented her to the
Princess, who was equally pleased, and forthwith determined
that they would both be Fêng’s wives.<a id="Anchor-383" title="Go to Footnote 383" href="#Footnote-383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> When
Fêng heard of this plan, he said to his wife, “With a
Prince’s daughter there can be no distinctions of first
and second wife;” but Mrs. Fêng paid no heed to him,
and immediately sent off to the Prince such an enormous
quantity of valuables that it took a thousand men
to carry them, and the Prince himself had never before
heard of such treasures in his life. Fêng was now
liberated once more, and solemnized his marriage with
the Princess.</p>

<p>One night after this he dreamt that the Eighth
Prince came to him and asked him to return his
former present, saying that to keep it too long would
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-35"><a id="Page_ii-35"></a></span>
be injurious to his chances of life. Fêng asked him to
take a drink, but the Eighth Prince said that he had
forsworn wine, acting under Fêng’s advice, for three
years. He then bit Fêng’s arm, and the latter waked up
with the pain to find that the cicatrix on his arm was no
longer there.</p>

<br/>
THE MAGIC PATH.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">In</span> the province of Kuangtung there lived a scholar
named Kuo, who was one evening on his way home from
a friend’s, when he lost his way among the hills. He
got into a thick jungle, where, after about an hour’s wandering,
he suddenly heard the sound of laughing and
talking on the top of the hill. Hurrying up in the
direction of the sound, he beheld some ten or a dozen
persons sitting on the ground engaged in drinking. No
sooner had they caught sight of Kuo than they all cried
out, “Come along! just room for one more; you’re in
the nick of time.” So Kuo sat down with the company,
most of whom, he noticed, belonged to the literati,<a id="Anchor-384" title="Go to Footnote 384" href="#Footnote-384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> and
began by asking them to direct him on his way home;
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-37"><a id="Page_ii-37"></a></span>
but one of them cried out, “A nice sort of fellow you
are, to be bothering about your way home, and paying
no attention to the fine moon we have got to-night.”
The speaker then presented him with a goblet of wine of
exquisite bouquet, which Kuo drank off at a draught,
and another gentleman filled up again for him at once.
Now, Kuo was pretty good in that line, and being very
thirsty withal from his long walk, tossed off bumper after
bumper, to the great delight of his hosts, who were
unanimous in voting him a jolly good fellow. He was,
moreover, full of fun, and could imitate exactly the note
of any kind of bird; so all of a sudden he began on the sly
to twitter like a swallow, to the great astonishment of the
others, who wondered how it was a swallow could be out
so late. He then changed his note to that of a cuckoo,
sitting there laughing and saying nothing, while his hosts
were discussing the extraordinary sounds they had just
heard. After a while he imitated a parrot, and cried,
“Mr. Kuo is very drunk: you’d better see him home;”
and then the sounds ceased, beginning again by-and-by,
when at last the others found out who it was, and all
burst out laughing. They screwed up their mouths and
tried to whistle like Kuo, but none of them could do so;
and soon one of them observed, “What a pity Madam
Ch‘ing isn’t with us: we must rendezvous here again at
mid-autumn, and you, Mr. Kuo, must be sure and
come.” Kuo said he would, whereupon another of his
hosts got up and remarked that, as he had given them
such an amusing entertainment, they would try to shew
him a few acrobatic feats. They all arose, and one of
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-38"><a id="Page_ii-38"></a></span>
them planting his feet firmly, a second jumped up on to
his shoulders, a third on to the second’s shoulders, and a
fourth on to his, until it was too high for the rest to jump
up, and accordingly they began to climb as though it
had been a ladder. When they were all up, and the
topmost head seemed to touch the clouds, the whole
column bent gradually down until it lay along the
ground transformed into a path. Kuo remained for
some time in a state of considerable alarm, and then,
setting out along this path, ultimately reached his own
home. Some days afterwards he revisited the spot, and
saw the remains of a feast lying about on the ground,
with dense bushes on all sides, but no sign of a path.
At mid-autumn he thought of keeping his engagement;
however, his friends persuaded him not to go.</p>

THE FAITHLESS WIDOW.</a><a id="Anchor-385" title="Go to Footnote 385" href="#Footnote-385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Niu</span> was a Kiangsi man who traded in piece
goods. He married a wife from the Chêng family, by
whom he had two children, a boy and a girl. When
thirty-three years of age he fell ill and died, his son
Chung being then only twelve and his little girl eight or
nine. His wife did not remain faithful to his memory,
but, selling off all the property, pocketed the proceeds
and married another man, leaving her two children
almost in a state of destitution with their aunt, Niu’s
sister-in-law, an old lady of sixty, who had lived with
them previously, and had now nowhere to seek a shelter.
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-40"><a id="Page_ii-40"></a></span>
A few years later this aunt died, and the family fortunes
began to sink even lower than before; Chung, however,
was now grown up, and determined to carry on his
father’s trade, only he had no capital to start with. His
sister marrying a rich trader named Mao, she begged her
husband to lend Chung ten ounces of silver, which he
did, and Chung immediately started for Nanking. On
the road he fell in with some bandits, who robbed him
of all he had, and consequently he was unable to
return; but one day when he was at a pawnshop he
noticed that the master of the shop was wonderfully like
his late father, and on going out and making inquiries
he found that this pawnbroker bore precisely the same
names. In great astonishment, he forthwith proceeded
to frequent the place with no other object than to watch
this man, who, on the other hand, took no notice of
Chung; and by the end of three days, having satisfied
himself that he really saw his own father, and yet not
daring to disclose his own identity, he made application
through one of the assistants, on the score of being
himself a Kiangsi man, to be employed in the shop.
Accordingly, an indenture was drawn up; and when the
master noticed Chung’s name and place of residence he
started, and asked him whence he came. With tears in
his eyes Chung addressed him by his father’s name, and
then the pawnbroker became lost in a deep reverie,
by-and-by asking Chung how his mother was. Now
Chung did not like to allude to his father’s death, and
turned the question by saying, “My father went away on
business six years ago, and never came back; my
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-41"><a id="Page_ii-41"></a></span>
mother married again and left us, and had it not been
for my aunt our corpses would long ago have been cast
out in the kennel.” Then the pawnbroker was much
moved, and cried out, “I am your father!” seizing his
son’s hand and leading him within to see his step-mother.
This lady was about twenty-two, and, having no children
of her own, was delighted with Chung, and prepared a
banquet for him in the inner apartments. Mr. Niu himself
was, however, somewhat melancholy, and wished to
return to his old home; but his wife, fearing that there
would be no one to manage the business, persuaded him
to remain; so he taught his son the trade, and in three
months was able to leave it all to him. He then prepared
for his journey, whereupon Chung informed his
step-mother that his father was really dead, to which she
replied in great consternation that she knew him only as
a trader to the place, and that six years previously he
had married her, which proved conclusively that he
couldn’t be dead. He then recounted the whole story,
which was a perfect mystery to both of them; and
twenty-four hours afterwards in walked his father, leading
a woman whose hair was all dishevelled. Chung looked
at her and saw that she was his own mother; and Niu
took her by the ear and began to revile her, saying,
“Why did you desert my children?” to which the
wretched woman made no reply. He then <a id="tn_25">bit</a> her
across the neck, at which she screamed to Chung for
assistance, and he, not being able to bear the sight,
stepped in between them. His father was more than
ever enraged at this, when, lo! Chung’s mother had disappeared.
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-42"><a id="Page_ii-42"></a></span>
While they were still lost in astonishment at
this strange scene, Mr. Niu’s colour changed; in another
moment his empty clothes had dropped upon the ground,
and he himself became a black vapour and also vanished
from their sight. The step-mother and son were much
overcome; they took Niu’s clothes and buried them,
and after that Chung continued his father’s business and
soon amassed great wealth. On returning to his native
place he found that his mother had actually died on the
very day of the above occurrence, and that his father
had been seen by the whole family.</p>

<br/>
THE PRINCESS OF THE TUNG-T‘ING
LAKE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Ch‘ên Pi-chiao</span> was a Pekingese; and being a poor
man he attached himself as secretary to the suite of a
high military official named Chia. On one occasion,
while anchored on the Tung-t‘ing lake, they saw a
dolphin<a id="Anchor-386" title="Go to Footnote 386" href="#Footnote-386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> floating on the surface of the water; and
General Chia took his bow and shot at it, wounding
the creature in the back. A fish was hanging on to
its tail, and would not let go; so both were pulled out
of the water together, and attached to the mast. There
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-44"><a id="Page_ii-44"></a></span>
they lay gasping, the dolphin opening its mouth as if
pleading for life, until at length young Ch‘ên begged the
General to let them go again; and then he himself half
jokingly put a piece of plaster upon the dolphin’s wound,
and had the two thrown back into the water, where they
were seen for some time afterwards diving and rising
again to the surface. About a year afterwards, Ch‘ên
was once more crossing the Tung-t‘ing lake on his way
home, when the boat was upset in a squall, and he himself
only saved by clinging to a bamboo crate, which
finally, after floating about all night, caught in the overhanging
branch of a tree, and thus enabled him to
scramble on shore. By-and-by, another body floated in,
and this turned out to be his servant; but on dragging
him out, he found life was already extinct. In great
distress, he sat himself down to rest, and saw beautiful
green hills and waving willows, but not a single human
being of whom he could ask the way. From early dawn
till the morning was far advanced he remained in that
state; and then, thinking he saw his servant’s body move,
he stretched out his hand to feel it, and before long
the man threw up several quarts of water and recovered
his consciousness. They now dried their clothes in the
sun, and by noon these were fit to put on; at which
period the pangs of hunger began to assail them, and
accordingly they started over the hills in the hope of
coming upon some habitation of man. As they were
walking along, an arrow whizzed past, and the next
moment two young ladies dashed by on handsome
palfreys. Each had a scarlet band round her head,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-45"><a id="Page_ii-45"></a></span>
with a bunch of pheasant’s feathers stuck in her hair,
and wore a purple riding-jacket with small sleeves,
confined by a green embroidered girdle round the waist.
One of them carried a cross-bow for shooting bullets,
and the other had on her arm a dark-coloured bow-and-arrow
case. Reaching the brow of the hill, Ch‘ên
beheld a number of riders engaged in beating the
surrounding cover, all of whom were beautiful girls
and dressed exactly alike. Afraid to advance any
further, he inquired of a youth who appeared to be in
attendance, and the latter told him that it was a hunting
party from the palace; and then, having supplied him
with food from his wallet, he bade him retire quickly,
adding that if he fell in with them he would assuredly
be put to death. Thereupon Ch‘ên hurried away; and
descending the hill, turned into a copse where there was
a building which he thought would in all probability be
a monastery. On getting nearer, he saw that the place
was surrounded by a wall, and between him and a half-open
red-door was a brook spanned by a stone bridge
leading up to it. Pulling back the door, he beheld
within a number of ornamental buildings circling in the
air like so many clouds, and for all the world resembling
the Imperial pleasure-grounds; and thinking it must
be the park of some official personage, he walked quietly
in, enjoying the delicious fragrance of the flowers as
he pushed aside the thick vegetation which obstructed
his way. After traversing a winding path fenced in by
balustrades, Ch‘ên reached a second enclosure, wherein
were a quantity of tall willow-trees which swept the red
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-46"><a id="Page_ii-46"></a></span>
eaves of the buildings with their branches. The note of
some bird would set the petals of the flowers fluttering
in the air, and the least wind would bring the seed-vessels
down from the elm-trees above; and the effect
upon the eye and heart of the beholder was something
quite unknown in the world of mortals. Passing
through a small kiosque, Ch‘ên and his servant came
upon a swing which seemed as though suspended from
the clouds, while the ropes hung idly down in the utter
stillness that prevailed.<a id="Anchor-387" title="Go to Footnote 387" href="#Footnote-387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Thinking by this that they
were approaching the ladies’ apartments,<a id="Anchor-388" title="Go to Footnote 388" href="#Footnote-388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Ch‘ên would
have turned back, but at that moment he heard sounds
of horses’ feet at the door, and what seemed to be
the laughter of a bevy of girls. So he and his servant
hid themselves in a bush; and by-and-by, as the sounds
came nearer, he heard one of the young ladies say,
“We’ve had but poor sport to-day;” whereupon another
cried out, “If the princess hadn’t shot that wild goose,
we should have taken all this trouble for nothing.”
Shortly after this, a number of girls dressed in red
came in escorting a young lady, who went and sat down
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-47"><a id="Page_ii-47"></a></span>
under the kiosque. She wore a hunting costume with
tight<a id="Anchor-389" title="Go to Footnote 389" href="#Footnote-389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> sleeves, and was about fourteen or fifteen years old.
Her hair looked like a cloud of mist at the back of her
head, and her waist seemed as though a breath of
wind might snap it<a id="Anchor-390" title="Go to Footnote 390" href="#Footnote-390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>&mdash;incomparable for beauty, even
among the celebrities of old. Just then the attendants
handed her some exquisitely fragrant tea, and stood
glittering round her like a bank of beautiful embroidery.
In a few moments the young lady arose and
descended the kiosque; at which one of her attendants
cried out, “Is your Highness too fatigued by riding
to take a turn in the swing?” The princess replied
that she was not; and immediately some supported
her under the shoulders, while others seized her arms,
and others again arranged her petticoats, and brought
her the proper shoes.<a id="Anchor-391" title="Go to Footnote 391" href="#Footnote-391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> Thus they helped her into the
swing, she herself stretching out her shining arms, and
putting her feet into a suitable pair of slippers; and
then&mdash;away she went, light as a flying-swallow, far up
into the fleecy clouds. As soon as she had had enough,
the attendants helped her out, and one of them exclaimed,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-48"><a id="Page_ii-48"></a></span>
“Truly, your Highness is a perfect angel!”
At this the young lady laughed, and walked away,
Ch‘ên gazing after her in a state of semi-consciousness,
until, at length, the voices died away, and he and his
servant crept forth. Walking up and down near the
swing, he suddenly espied a red handkerchief near
the paling, which he knew had been dropped by one
of the young ladies; and, thrusting it joyfully into his
sleeve, he walked up and entered the kiosque. There,
upon a table, lay writing materials, and taking out
the handkerchief he indited upon it the following
<span class="nowrap">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse_i3-5"><span class="legacy-indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“What form divine was just now sporting nigh?&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse_i-0-5">’Twas she, I trow of ‘golden lily’ fame;</div>
<div class="verse_i0">Her charms the moon’s fair denizens might shame,</div>
<div class="verse_i4"><span class="legacy-indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Her fairy footsteps bear her to the sky.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Humming this stanza to himself, Ch‘ên walked along
seeking for the path by which he had entered; but
every door was securely barred, and he knew not what
to do. So he went back to the kiosque, when suddenly
one of the young ladies appeared, and asked him in
astonishment what he did there. “I have lost my way,”
replied Ch‘ên; “I pray you lend me your assistance.”
“Do you happen to have found a red handkerchief?” said
the girl. “I have, indeed,” answered Ch‘ên, “but I fear
I have made it somewhat dirty;” and, suiting the action to
the word, he drew it forth, and handed it to her. “Wretched
man!” cried the young lady, “you are undone. This
is a handkerchief the princess is constantly using, and you
have gone and scribbled all over it; what will become of
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-49"><a id="Page_ii-49"></a></span>
you now?” Ch‘ên was in a great fright, and begged the
young lady to intercede for him; to which she replied,
“It was bad enough that you should come here and
spy about; however, being a scholar, and a man of
refinement, I would have done my best for you; but
after this, how am I to help you?” Off she then ran
with the handkerchief, while Ch‘ên remained behind
in an agony of suspense, and longing for the wings of a
bird to bear him away from his fate. By-and-by, the
young lady returned and congratulated him, saying,
“There is some hope for you. The Princess read your
verses several times over, and was not at all angry. You
will probably be released; but, meanwhile, wait here,
and don’t climb the trees, or try to get through the
walls, or you may not escape after all.” Evening was
now drawing on, and Ch‘ên knew not, for certain, what
was about to happen; at the same time he was very
empty, and, what with hunger and anxiety, death would
have been almost a happy release. Before long, the
young lady returned with a lamp in her hand, and
followed by a slave-girl bearing wine and food, which
she forthwith presented to Ch‘ên. The latter asked if
there was any news about himself; to which the young
lady replied that she had just mentioned his case to
the Princess who, not knowing what to do with him
at that hour of the night, had given orders that he
should at once be provided with food, “which, at any
rate,” added she, “is not bad news.” The whole night
long Ch‘ên walked up and down unable to take rest;
and it was not till late in the morning that the young
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-50"><a id="Page_ii-50"></a></span>
lady appeared with more food for him. Imploring her
once more to intercede on his behalf, she told him that
the Princess had not instructed them either to kill or to
release him, and that it would not be fitting for such as
herself to be bothering the Princess with suggestions.
So there Ch‘ên still remained until another day had
almost gone, hoping for the welcome moment; and then
the young lady rushed hurriedly in, saying, “You are
lost! Some one has told the Queen, and she, in a fit
of anger, threw the handkerchief on the ground, and
made use of very violent language. Oh dear! oh dear!
I’m sure something dreadful will happen.” Ch‘ên threw
himself on his knees, his face as pale as ashes, and
begged to know what he should do; but at that moment
sounds were heard outside, and the young lady waved
her hand to him, and ran away. Immediately a crowd
came pouring in through the door, with ropes ready
to secure the object of their search; and among them
was a slave-girl, who looked fixedly at our hero, and
cried out, “Why, surely you are Mr. Ch‘ên, aren’t you?”
at the same time stopping the others from binding him
until she should have reported to the Queen. In a few
minutes she came back, and said the Queen requested
him to walk in; and in he went, through a number
of doors, trembling all the time with fear, until he
reached a hall, the screen before which was ornamented
with green jade and silver. A beautiful girl drew aside
the bamboo curtain at the door, and announced, “Mr.
Ch‘ên;” and he himself advanced, and fell down before
a lady, who was sitting upon a dais at the other end,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-51"><a id="Page_ii-51"></a></span>
knocking his head upon the ground, and crying out,
“Thy servant is from a far-off country; spare, oh!
spare his life.” “Sir!” replied the Queen, rising hastily
from her seat, and extending a hand to Ch‘ên, “but for
you, I should not be here to-day. Pray excuse the
rudeness of my maids.” Thereupon a splendid repast
was served, and wine was poured out in chased goblets,
to the no small astonishment of Ch‘ên, who could not
understand why he was treated thus. “Your kindness,”
observed the Queen, “in restoring me to life, I am
quite unable to repay; however, as you have made
my daughter the subject of your verse, the match is
clearly ordained by fate, and I shall send her along
to be your handmaid.” Ch‘ên hardly knew what to
make of this extraordinary accomplishment of his wishes,
but the marriage was solemnized there and then; bands
of music struck up wedding-airs, beautiful mats were laid
down for them to walk upon, and the whole place was
brilliantly lighted with a profusion of coloured lamps.
Then Ch‘ên said to the Princess, “That a stray and
unknown traveller like myself, guilty of spoiling your
Highness’s handkerchief, should have escaped the
fate he deserved, was already more than could be
expected; but now to receive you in marriage&mdash;this,
indeed, far surpasses my wildest expectations.” “My
mother,” replied the Princess, “is married to the King
of this lake, and is herself a daughter of the River
Prince. Last year, when on her way to visit her parents,
she happened to cross the lake, and was wounded by an
arrow; but you saved her life, and gave her plaster for
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-52"><a id="Page_ii-52"></a></span>
the wound. Our family, therefore, is grateful to you,
and can never forget your good act. And do not regard
me as of another species than yourself; the Dragon King
has bestowed upon me the elixir of immortality, and this
I will gladly share with you.” Then Ch‘ên knew that
his wife was a spirit, and by-and-by he asked her how
the slave-girl had recognised him; to which she replied,
that the girl was the small fish which had been found
hanging to the dolphin’s tail. He then inquired why,
as they didn’t intend to kill him, he had been kept so
long a prisoner. “I was charmed with your literary
talent,” answered the Princess, “but I did not venture
to take the responsibility upon myself; and no one saw
how I tossed and turned the livelong night.” “Dear
friend,” said Ch‘ên; “but, come, tell me who was it that
brought my food.” “A trusty waiting-maid of mine,”
replied the Princess; “her name is A-nien.” Ch‘ên
then asked how he could ever repay her, and the
Princess told him there would be plenty of time to
think of that; and when he inquired where the king,
her father, was, she said he had gone off with the God
of War to fight against Ch‘ih-yu,<a id="Anchor-392" title="Go to Footnote 392" href="#Footnote-392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> and had not returned.
A few days passed, and Ch‘ên began to think his people
at home would be anxious about him; so he sent off
his servant with a letter to tell them he was safe and
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-53"><a id="Page_ii-53"></a></span>
sound, at which they were all overjoyed, believing him
to have been lost in the wreck of the boat, of which
event news had already reached them. However, they
were unable to send him any reply, and were considerably
distressed as to how he would find his way home again.
Six months afterwards Ch‘ên himself appeared, dressed
in fine clothes, and riding on a splendid horse, with
plenty of money, and valuable jewels in his pocket&mdash;evidently
a man of wealth. From that time forth he
kept up a magnificent establishment; and in seven or
eight years had become the father of five children.
Every day he kept open house, and if any one asked
him about his adventures, he would readily tell them
without reservation. Now a friend of his, named Liang,
whom he had known since they were boys together, and
who, after holding an appointment for some years in
Nan-fu, was crossing the Tung-t‘ing Lake, on his way
home, suddenly beheld an ornamental barge, with carved
wood-work and red windows, passing over the foamy
waves to the sound of music and singing from within.
Just then a beautiful young lady leant out of one of the
windows, which she had pushed open, and by her side
Liang saw a young man sitting, in a <i xml:lang="fr">négligé</i> attitude,
while two nice-looking girls stood by and shampooed<a id="Anchor-393" title="Go to Footnote 393" href="#Footnote-393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-54"><a id="Page_ii-54"></a></span>
him. Liang, at first, thought it must be the party of
some high official, and wondered at the scarcity of
attendants;<a id="Anchor-394" title="Go to Footnote 394" href="#Footnote-394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> but, on looking more closely at the young
man, he saw it was no other than his old friend Ch‘ên.
Thereupon he began almost involuntarily to shout out
to him; and when Ch‘ên heard his own name, he
stopped the rowers, and walked out towards the figure-head,<a id="Anchor-395" title="Go to Footnote 395" href="#Footnote-395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
beckoning Liang to cross over into his boat,
where the remains of their feast was quickly cleared
away, and fresh supplies of wine, and tea, and all kinds
of costly foods spread out by handsome slave-girls.
“It’s ten years since we met,” said Liang, “and what a
rich man you have become in the meantime.” “Well,”
replied Ch‘ên, “do you think that so very extraordinary
for a poor fellow like me?” Liang then asked him who
was the lady with whom he was taking wine, and Ch‘ên
said she was his wife, which very much astonished Liang,
who further inquired whither they were going. “Westwards,”
answered Ch‘ên, and prevented any further questions
by giving a signal for the music, which effectually
put a stop to all further conversation.<a id="Anchor-396" title="Go to Footnote 396" href="#Footnote-396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> By-and-by,
Liang found the wine getting into his head, and seized
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-55"><a id="Page_ii-55"></a></span>
the opportunity to ask Ch‘ên to make him a present of
one of his beautiful slave-girls. “You are drunk,<a id="Anchor-397" title="Go to Footnote 397" href="#Footnote-397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> my
friend,” replied Ch‘ên; “however, I will give you the
price of one as a pledge of our old friendship.” And,
turning to a servant, he bade him present Liang with
a splendid pearl, saying, “Now you can buy a Green
Pearl;<a id="Anchor-398" title="Go to Footnote 398" href="#Footnote-398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> you see I am not stingy;” adding forthwith,
“but I am pressed for time, and can stay no longer with
my old friend.” So he escorted Liang back to his boat,
and, having let go the rope, proceeded on his way. Now,
when Liang reached home, and called at Ch‘ên’s house,
whom should he see but Ch‘ên himself drinking with
a party of friends. “Why, I saw you only yesterday,”
cried Liang, “upon the Tung-t‘ing. How quickly you
have got back!” Ch‘ên denied this, and then Liang
repeated the whole story, at the conclusion of which,
Ch‘ên laughed, and said, “You must be mistaken. Do
you imagine I can be in two places at once?” The
company were all much astonished, and knew not what
to make of it; and subsequently when Ch‘ên, who died
at the age of eighty, was being carried to his grave,
the bearers thought the coffin seemed remarkably light,
and on opening it to see, found that the body had
disappeared.</p>

<br/>
THE PRINCESS LILY.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Chiao-chou there lived a man named Tou Hsün,
otherwise known as Hsiao-hui. One day he had just
dropped off to sleep when he beheld a man in serge
clothes standing by the bedside, and apparently anxious
to communicate something to him. Tou inquired his
errand; to which the man replied that he was the bearer
of an invitation from his master. “And who is your
master?” asked Tou. “Oh, he doesn’t live far off,”
replied the other; so away they went together, and after
some time came to a place where there were innumerable
white houses rising one above the other, and shaded
by dense groves of lemon-trees. They threaded their
way past countless doors, not at all similar to those
usually used, and saw a great many official-looking men
and women passing and repassing, each of whom called
out to the man in serge, “Has Mr. Tou come?” to
which he always replied in the affirmative. Here a
mandarin met them and escorted Tou into a palace,
upon which the latter remarked, “This is really very
kind of you; but I haven’t the honour of knowing you,
and I feel somewhat diffident about going in.” “Our
Prince,” answered his guide, “has long heard of you as
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-57"><a id="Page_ii-57"></a></span>
a man of good family and excellent principles, and is
very anxious to make your acquaintance.” “Who is
your Prince?” inquired Tou. “You’ll see for yourself
in a moment,” said the other; and just then out came
two girls with banners, and guided Tou through a great
number of doors until they came to a throne, upon
which sat the Prince. His Highness immediately descended
to meet him, and made him take the seat of
honour; after which ceremony exquisite viands of all
kinds were spread out before them. Looking up, Tou
noticed a scroll, on which was inscribed, <i>The Cassia
Court</i>, and he was just beginning to feel puzzled as to
what he should say next, when the Prince addressed him
as follows:&mdash;“The honour of having you for a neighbour
is, as it were, a bond of affinity between us. Let
us, then, give ourselves up to enjoyment, and put away
suspicion and fear.” Tou murmured his acquiescence;
and when the wine had gone round several times there
arose from a distance the sound of pipes and singing,
unaccompanied, however, by the usual drum, and very
much subdued in volume. Thereupon the Prince
looked about him and cried out, “We are about to
set a verse for any of you gentlemen to cap; here you
are:&mdash;‘<i>Genius seeks the Cassia Court</i>.’” While the
courtiers were all engaged in thinking of some fit
antithesis,<a id="Anchor-399" title="Go to Footnote 399" href="#Footnote-399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> Tou added, “<i>Refinement loves the Lily flower;</i>”
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-58"><a id="Page_ii-58"></a></span>
upon which the Prince exclaimed, “How strange! Lily
is my daughter’s name; and, after such a coincidence,
she must come in for you to see her.” In a few moments
the tinkling of her ornaments and a delicious
fragrance of musk announced the arrival of the Princess,
who was between sixteen and seventeen and endowed
with surpassing beauty. The Prince bade her make an
obeisance to Tou, at the same time introducing her as
his daughter Lily; and as soon as the ceremony was
over the young lady moved away. Tou remained in a
state of stupefaction, and, when the Prince proposed
that they should pledge each other in another bumper,
paid not the slightest attention to what he said. Then
the Prince, perceiving what had distracted his guest’s
attention, remarked that he was anxious to find a consort
for his daughter, but that unfortunately there was
the difficulty of <em>species</em>, and he didn’t know what to do;
but again Tou took no notice of what the Prince was
saying, until at length one of the bystanders plucked his
sleeve, and asked him if he hadn’t seen that the Prince
wished to drink with him, and had just been addressing
some remarks to him. Thereupon Tou started, and, recovering
himself at once, rose from the table and
apologized to the Prince for his rudeness, declaring that
he had taken so much wine he didn’t know what he
was doing. “Besides,” said he, “your Highness has
doubtless business to transact; I will therefore take my
leave.” “I am extremely pleased to have seen you,”
replied the Prince, “and only regret that you are in such
a hurry to be gone. However, I won’t detain you now;
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-59"><a id="Page_ii-59"></a></span>
but, if you don’t forget all about us, I shall be very glad
to invite you here again.” He then gave orders that Tou
should be escorted home; and on the way one of the
courtiers asked the latter why he had said nothing when
the Prince had spoken of a consort for his daughter, as
his Highness had evidently made the remark with an
eye to securing Tou as his son-in-law. The latter was
now sorry that he had missed his opportunity; meanwhile
they reached his house, and he himself awoke.
The sun had already set, and there he sat in the gloom
thinking of what had happened. In the evening he put
out his candle, hoping to continue his dream; but, alas!
the thread was broken, and all he could do was to pour
forth his repentance in sighs. One night he was sleeping
at a friend’s house when suddenly an officer of the
court walked in and summoned him to appear before the
Prince; so up he jumped, and hurried off at once to the
palace, where he prostrated himself before the throne.
The Prince raised him and made him sit down, saying
that since they had last met he had become aware that
Tou would be willing to marry his daughter, and hoped
that he might be allowed to offer her as a handmaid.
Tou rose and thanked the Prince, who thereupon gave
orders for a banquet to be prepared; and when they had
finished their wine it was announced that the Princess
had completed her toilet. Immediately a bevy of young
ladies came in with the Princess in their midst, a red
veil covering her head, and her tiny footsteps sounding
like rippling water as they led her up to be introduced to
Tou. When the ceremonies were concluded, Tou said
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-60"><a id="Page_ii-60"></a></span>
to the Princess, “In your presence, Madam, it would be
easy to forget even death itself; but, tell me, is not this
all a dream?” “And how can it be a dream,” asked
the Princess, “when you and I are here together?”</p>

<p>Next morning Tou amused himself by helping the
Princess to paint her face,<a id="Anchor-400" title="Go to Footnote 400" href="#Footnote-400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> and then, seizing a girdle,
began to measure the size of her waist<a id="Anchor-401" title="Go to Footnote 401" href="#Footnote-401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> and the length
of her fingers and feet. “Are you crazy?” cried she,
laughing; to which Tou replied, “I have been deceived
so often by dreams, that I am now making a careful
record. If such it turns out to be, I shall still have
something as a souvenir of you.” While they were thus
chatting a maid rushed into the room, shrieking out,
“Alas, alas! a great monster has got into the palace:
the Prince has fled into a side chamber: destruction is
surely come upon us.” Tou was in a great fright when
he heard this, and rushed off to see the Prince, who
grasped his hand and, with tears in his eyes, begged him
not to desert them. “Our relationship,” cried he, “was
cemented when Heaven sent this calamity upon us; and
now my kingdom will be overthrown. What shall I
do?” Tou begged to know what was the matter; and
then the Prince laid a despatch upon the table, telling
Tou to open it and make himself acquainted with its
contents. This despatch ran as follows:&mdash;“The Grand
Secretary of State, Black Wings, to His Royal Highness,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-61"><a id="Page_ii-61"></a></span>
announcing the arrival of an extraordinary monster, and
advising the immediate removal of the Court in order to
preserve the vitality of the empire. A report has just
been received from the officer in charge of the Yellow
Gate stating that, ever since the 6th of the 5th moon, a
huge monster, 10,000 feet in length, has been lying
coiled up outside the entrance to the palace, and that it
has already devoured 13,800 and odd of your Highness’s
subjects, and is spreading desolation far and wide. On
receipt of this information your servant proceeded to
make a reconnaissance, and there beheld a venomous
reptile with a head as big as a mountain and eyes like
vast sheets of water. Every time it raised its head,
whole buildings disappeared down its throat; and, on
stretching itself out, walls and houses were alike laid in
ruins. In all antiquity there is no record of such a
scourge. The fate of our temples and ancestral halls is
now a mere question of hours; we therefore pray your
Royal Highness to depart at once with the Royal Family
and seek somewhere else a happier abode.”<a id="Anchor-402" title="Go to Footnote 402" href="#Footnote-402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> When
Tou had read this document his face turned ashy pale;
and just then a messenger rushed in, shrieking out,
“Here is the monster!” at which the whole Court burst
into lamentations as if their last hour was at hand. The
Prince was beside himself with fear; all he could do
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-62"><a id="Page_ii-62"></a></span>
was to beg Tou to look to his own safety without regarding
the wife through whom he was involved in their
misfortunes. The Princess, however, who was standing
by bitterly lamenting the fate that had fallen upon them,
begged Tou not to desert her; and, after a moment’s
hesitation, he said he should be only too happy to place
his own poor home at their immediate disposal if they
would only deign to honour him. “How can we talk of
<em>deigning</em>,” cried the Princess, “at such a moment as
this? I pray you take us there as quickly as possible.”
So Tou gave her his arm, and in no time they had arrived
at Tou’s house, which the Princess at once
pronounced to be a charming place of residence, and
better even than their former kingdom. “But I must
now ask you,” said she to Tou, “to make some arrangement
for my father and mother, that the old order of
things may be continued here.” Tou at first offered
objections to this; whereupon the Princess said that a
man who would not help another in his hour of need
was not much of a man, and immediately went off into
a fit of hysterics, from which Tou was trying his best to
recall her, when all of a sudden he awoke and found
that it was all a dream. However, he still heard a
buzzing in his ears which he knew was not made by any
human being, and, on looking carefully about he discovered
two or three bees which had settled on his
pillow. He was very much astonished at this, and consulted
with his friend, who was also greatly amazed at
his strange story; and then the latter pointed out a
number of other bees on various parts of his dress, none
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-63"><a id="Page_ii-63"></a></span>
of which would go away even when brushed off. His
friend now advised him to get a hive for them, which he
did without delay; and immediately it was filled by a
whole swarm of bees, which came flying from over the
wall in great numbers. On tracing whence they had come,
it was found that they belonged to an old gentleman who
lived near, and who had kept bees for more than thirty
years previously. Tou thereupon went and told him the
story; and when the old gentleman examined his hive
he found the bees all gone. On breaking it open he
discovered a large snake inside of about ten feet in
length, which he immediately killed, recognising in it
the “huge monster” of Tou’s adventure. As for the
bees, they remained with Tou, and increased in numbers
every year.</p>

THE DONKEY’S REVENGE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Chung Ch‘ing-yü</span> was a scholar of some reputation,
who lived in Manchuria. When he went up for his
master’s degree, he heard that there was a Taoist priest
at the capital who would tell people’s fortunes, and was
very anxious to see him; and at the conclusion of the
second part of the examination,<a id="Anchor-403" title="Go to Footnote 403" href="#Footnote-403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> he accidentally met
him at Pao-t‘u-ch‘üan.<a id="Anchor-404" title="Go to Footnote 404" href="#Footnote-404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> The priest was over sixty years
of age, and had the usual white beard, flowing down
over his breast. Around him stood a perfect wall of
people inquiring their future fortunes, and to each the
old man made a brief reply: but when he saw Chung
among the crowd, he was overjoyed, and, seizing him by
the hand, said, “Sir, your virtuous intentions command
my esteem.” He then led him up behind a screen, and
asked if he did not wish to know what was to come;
and when Chung replied in the affirmative, the priest
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-65"><a id="Page_ii-65"></a></span>
informed him that his prospects were bad. “You may
succeed in passing this examination,” continued he, “but
on returning covered with honour to your home, I fear
that your mother will be no longer there.” Now Chung
was a very filial son; and as soon as he heard these
words, his tears began to flow, and he declared that he
would go back without competing any further. The
priest observed that if he let this chance slip, he could
never hope for success; to which Chung replied that, on
the other hand, if his mother were to die he could never
hope to have her back again, and that even the rank of
Viceroy would not repay him for her loss. “Well,”
said the priest, “you and I were connected in a former
existence, and I must do my best to help you now.”
So he took out a pill which he gave to Chung, and told
him that if he sent it post-haste by some one to his
mother, it would prolong her life for seven days, and
thus he would be able to see her once again after the
examination was over. Chung took the pill, and went
off in very low spirits; but <a id="tn_15">he</a> soon reflected that the
span of human life is a matter of destiny, and that
every day he could spend at home would be one more
day devoted to the service of his mother. Accordingly,
he got ready to start at once, and, hiring a donkey,
actually set out on his way back. When he had gone
about half-a-mile, the donkey turned round and ran
home; and when he used his whip, the animal threw
itself down on the ground. Chung got into a great
perspiration, and his servant recommended him to
remain where he was; but this he would not hear of,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-66"><a id="Page_ii-66"></a></span>
and hired another donkey, which served him exactly
the same trick as the other one. The sun was now
sinking behind the hills, and his servant advised his
master to stay and finish his examination while he
himself went back home before him. Chung had no
alternative but to assent, and the next day he hurried
through with his papers, starting immediately afterwards,
and not stopping at all on the way either to eat or to
sleep. All night long he went on, and arrived to find
his mother in a very critical state; however, when he
gave her the pill she so far recovered that he was able
to go in and see her. Grasping his hand, she begged
him not to weep, telling him that she had just dreamt
she had been down to the Infernal Regions, where the
King of Hell had informed her with a gracious smile
that her record was fairly clean, and that in view of the
filial piety of her son she was to have twelve years more
of life. Chung was rejoiced at this, and his mother
was soon restored to her former health.</p>

<p>Before long the news arrived that Chung had passed
his examination; upon which he bade adieu to his
mother, and went off to the capital, where he bribed the
eunuchs of the palace to communicate with his friend
the Taoist priest. The latter was very much pleased,
and came out to see him, whereupon Chung prostrated
himself at his feet. “Ah,” said the priest, “this
success of yours, and the prolongation of your good
mother’s life, is all a reward for your virtuous conduct.
What have I done in the matter?” Chung was very
much astonished that the priest should already know
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-67"><a id="Page_ii-67"></a></span>
what had happened; however, he now inquired as to
his own future. “You will never rise to high rank,”
replied the priest, “but you will attain the years of an
octogenarian. In a former state of existence you and
I were once travelling together, when you threw a stone
at a dog, and accidentally killed a frog. Now that frog
has re-appeared in life as a donkey, and according to
all principles of destiny you ought to suffer for what
you did; but your filial piety has touched the Gods, a
protecting star-influence has passed into your nativity
sheet, and you will come to no harm. On the other
hand, there is your wife; in her former state she was
not as virtuous as she might have been, and her punishment
in this life was to be widowed quite young; you,
however, have secured the prolongation of your own
term of years, and therefore I fear that before long
your wife will pay the penalty of death.” Chung
was much grieved at hearing this; but after a while
he asked the priest where his second wife to
be was living. “At Chung-chou,” replied the latter;
“she is now fourteen years old.” The priest then
bade him adieu, telling him that if any mischance
should befall him he was to hurry off towards the south-east.
About a year after this, Chung’s wife did die;
and his mother then desiring him to go and visit his
uncle, who was a magistrate in Kiangsi, on which
journey he would have to pass through Chung-chou,
it seemed like a fulfilment of the old priest’s prophecy.
As he went along, he came to a village on the banks
of a river, where a large crowd of people was gathered
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-68"><a id="Page_ii-68"></a></span>
together round a theatrical performance which was going
on there. Chung would have passed quietly by, had
not a stray donkey followed so close behind him that he
turned round and hit it over the ears. This startled
the donkey so much that it ran off full gallop, and
knocked a rich gentleman’s child, who was sitting with
its nurse on the bank, right into the water, before any
one of the servants could lend a hand to save it.
Immediately there was a great outcry against Chung,
who gave his mule the rein and dashed away, mindful
of the priest’s warning, towards the south-east. After
riding about seven miles, he reached a mountain village,
where he saw an old man standing at the door of a
house, and, jumping off his mule, made him a low
bow. The old man asked him in, and inquired his
name and whence he came; to which Chung replied by
telling him the whole adventure. “Never fear,” said
the old man; “you can stay here, while I send out to
learn the position of affairs.” By the evening his messenger
had returned, and then they knew for the first
time that the child belonged to a wealthy family. The
old man looked grave and said, “Had it been anybody
else’s child, I might have helped you; as it is I can do
nothing.” Chung was greatly alarmed at this; however,
the old man told him to remain quietly there for the
night, and see what turn matters might take. Chung
was overwhelmed with anxiety, and did not sleep a
wink; and next morning he heard that the constables
were after him, and that it was death to any one who
should conceal him. The old man changed countenance
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-69"><a id="Page_ii-69"></a></span>
at this, and went inside, leaving Chung to his own
reflections; but towards the middle of the night he
came and knocked at Chung’s door, and, sitting down,
began to ask how old his wife was. Chung replied that
he was a widower; at which the old man seemed rather
pleased, and declared that in such case help would be
forthcoming; “for,” said he, “my sister’s husband has
taken the vows and become a priest,<a id="Anchor-405" title="Go to Footnote 405" href="#Footnote-405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> and my sister
herself has died, leaving an orphan girl who has now no
home; and if you would only marry her....”
Chung was delighted, more especially as this would be
both the fulfilment of the Taoist priest’s prophecy, and a
means of extricating himself from his present difficulty;
at the same time, he declared he should be sorry to
implicate his future father-in-law. “Never fear about
that,” replied the old man; “my sister’s husband is
pretty skilful in the black art. He has not mixed much
with the world of late; but when you are married, you
can discuss the matter with my niece.” So Chung
married the young lady, who was sixteen years of age,
and very beautiful; but whenever he looked at her he
took occasion to sigh. At last she said, “I may be
ugly; but you needn’t be in such a hurry to let me
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-70"><a id="Page_ii-70"></a></span>
know it;” whereupon Chung begged her pardon, and
said he felt himself only too lucky to have met with such
a divine creature; adding that he sighed because he
feared some misfortune was coming on them which
would separate them for ever. He then told her his
story, and the young lady was very angry that she should
have been drawn into such a difficulty without a word of
warning. Chung fell on his knees, and said he had
already consulted with her uncle, who was unable himself
to do anything, much as he wished it. He continued
that he was aware of her power; and then,
pointing out that his alliance was not altogether beneath
her, made all kinds of promises if she would only help
him out of this trouble. The young lady was no
longer able to refuse, but informed him that to apply
to her father would entail certain disagreeable consequences,
as he had retired from the world, and did
not any more recognise her as his daughter. That
night they did not attempt to sleep, spending the interval
in padding their knees with thick felt concealed
beneath their clothes; and then they got into chairs and
were carried off to the hills. After journeying some
distance, they were compelled by the nature of the road
to alight and walk; and it was only by a great effort
that Chung succeeded at last in getting his wife to the
top. At the door of the temple they sat down to rest,
the powder and paint on the young lady’s face having
all mixed with the perspiration trickling down; but when
Chung began to apologize for bringing her to this pass,
she replied that it was a mere trifle compared with what
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-71"><a id="Page_ii-71"></a></span>
was to come. By-and-by, they went inside; and
threading their way to the wall beyond, found the
young lady’s father sitting in contemplation,<a id="Anchor-406" title="Go to Footnote 406" href="#Footnote-406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> his eyes
closed, and a servant-boy standing by with a chowry.<a id="Anchor-407" title="Go to Footnote 407" href="#Footnote-407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
Everything was beautifully clean and nice, but before
the dais were sharp stones scattered about as thick as
the stars in the sky. The young lady did not venture
to select a favourable spot; she fell on her knees at once,
and Chung did likewise behind her. Then her father
opened his eyes, shutting them again almost instantaneously;
whereupon the young lady said, “For a long
time I have not paid my respects to you. I am now
married, and I have brought my husband to see you.”
A long time passed away, and then her father opened
his eyes and said, “You’re giving a great deal of
trouble,” immediately relapsing into silence again.
There the husband and wife remained until the stones
seemed to pierce into their very bones; but after a
while the father cried out, “Have you brought the
donkey?” His daughter replied that they had not;
whereupon they were told to go and fetch it at once,
which they did, not knowing what the meaning of this
order was. After a few more days’ kneeling, they
suddenly heard that the murderer of the child had been
caught and beheaded, and were just congratulating each
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-72"><a id="Page_ii-72"></a></span>
other on the success of their scheme, when a servant
came in with a stick in his hand, the top of which had
been chopped off. “This stick,” said the servant, “died
instead of you. Bury it reverently, that the wrong done
to the tree may be somewhat atoned for.”<a id="Anchor-408" title="Go to Footnote 408" href="#Footnote-408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> Then Chung
saw that at the place where the top of the stick had
been chopped off there were traces of blood; he therefore
buried it with the usual ceremony, and immediately
set off with his wife, and returned to his own home.</p>

<br/>
THE WOLF DREAM.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Pai</span> was a native of Chi-li, and his eldest son
was called Chia. The latter had been some two years
holding an appointment<a id="Anchor-409" title="Go to Footnote 409" href="#Footnote-409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> as magistrate in the south; but
because of the great distance between them, his family
had heard nothing of him. One day a distant connection,
named Ting, called at the house; and Mr. Pai,
not having seen this gentleman for a long time, treated
him with much cordiality. Now Ting was one of those
persons who are occasionally employed by the Judge of
the Infernal Regions to make arrests on earth;<a id="Anchor-410" title="Go to Footnote 410" href="#Footnote-410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> and, as
they were chatting together, Mr. Pai questioned him
about the realms below. Ting told him all kinds of
strange things, but Pai did not believe them, answering
only by a smile. Some days afterwards, he had just lain
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-74"><a id="Page_ii-74"></a></span>
down to sleep when Ting walked in and asked him to go
for a stroll; so they went off together, and by-and-by
reached the city. “There,” said Ting, pointing to a
door, “lives your nephew,” alluding to a son of Mr.
Pai’s elder sister, who was a magistrate in Honan; and
when Pai expressed his doubts as to the accuracy of this
statement, Ting led him in, when, lo and behold! there
was his nephew, sitting in his court dressed in his official
robes. Around him stood the guard, and it was impossible
to get near him; but Ting remarked that his son’s
residence was not far off, and asked Pai if he would not
like to see him too. The latter assenting, they walked
along till they came to a large building, which Ting said
was the place. However, there was a fierce wolf at the
entrance,<a id="Anchor-411" title="Go to Footnote 411" href="#Footnote-411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> and Mr. Pai was afraid to go in. Ting bade
him enter, and accordingly they walked in, when they
found that all the employés of the place, some of whom
were standing about and others lying down to sleep,
were all wolves. The central pathway was piled up with
whitening bones, and Mr. Pai began to feel horribly
alarmed but Ting kept close to him all the time, and
at length they got safely in. Pai’s son, Chia, was just
coming out; and when he saw his father accompanied
by Ting, he was overjoyed, and, asking them to sit
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-75"><a id="Page_ii-75"></a></span>
down, bade the attendants serve some refreshment.
Thereupon a great big wolf brought in in his mouth
the carcase of a dead man, and set it before them, at
which Mr. Pai rose up in consternation, and asked his
son what this meant. “It’s only a little refreshment for
you, father,” replied Chia; but this did not calm Mr.
Pai’s agitation, who would have retired precipitately, had
it not been for the crowd of wolves which barred the
path. Just as he was at a loss what to do, there was a
general stampede among the animals which scurried
away, some under the couches and some under the
tables and chairs; and while he was wondering what the
cause of this could be, in marched two knights in golden
armour, who looked sternly at Chia, and, producing a
black rope, proceeded to bind him hand and foot. Chia
fell down before them, and was changed into a tiger with
horrid fangs; and then one of the knights drew a glittering
sword and would have cut off its head, had not
the other cried out, “Not yet! not yet! that is for the
fourth month next year. Let us now only take out its
teeth.” Immediately that knight produced a huge
mallet, and, with a few blows, scattered the tiger’s teeth
all over the floor, the tiger roaring so loudly with pain as
to shake the very hills, and frightening all the wits out of
Mr. Pai&mdash;who woke up with a start. He found he had
been dreaming, and at once sent off to invite Ting to
come and see him; but Ting sent back to say he must
beg to be excused. Then Mr. Pai, pondering on what
he had seen in his dream, despatched his second son
with a letter to Chia, full of warnings and good advice;
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-76"><a id="Page_ii-76"></a></span>
and lo! when his son arrived, he found that his elder
brother had lost all his front teeth, these having been
knocked out, as he averred, by a fall he had had from
his horse when tipsy; and, on comparing dates, the day
of that fall was found to coincide with the day of his
father’s dream. The younger brother was greatly amazed
at this, and took out their father’s letter, which he gave
to Chia to read. The latter changed colour, but immediately
asked his brother what there was to be astonished
at in the coincidence of a dream. And just at that time
he was busily engaged in bribing his superiors to put him
first on the list for promotion, so that he soon forgot all
about the circumstance; while the younger, observing
what harpies Chia’s subordinates were, taking presents
from one man and using their influence for another, in
one unbroken stream of corruption, sought out his elder
brother, and, with tears in his eyes, implored him to put
some check upon their rapacity. “My brother,” replied
Chia, “your life has been passed in an obscure village;
you know nothing of our official routine. We are promoted
or degraded at the will of our superiors, and not
by the voice of the people. He, therefore, who gratifies
his superiors is marked out for success;<a id="Anchor-412" title="Go to Footnote 412" href="#Footnote-412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> whereas he
who consults the wishes of the people is unable to gratify
his superiors as well.” Chia’s brother saw that his advice
was thrown away; he accordingly returned home and
told his father all that had taken place. The old man
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-77"><a id="Page_ii-77"></a></span>
was much affected, but there was nothing that he could do
in the matter, so he devoted himself to assisting the poor,
and such acts of charity, daily praying the Gods that the
wicked son alone might suffer for his crimes, and not
entail misery on his innocent wife and children. The
next year it was reported that Chia had been recommended
for a post in the Board of Civil Office,<a id="Anchor-413" title="Go to Footnote 413" href="#Footnote-413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> and
friends crowded the father’s door, offering their congratulations
upon the happy event. But the old man sighed
and took to his bed, pretending he was too unwell to
receive visitors. Before long another message came, informing
them that Chia had fallen in with bandits while
on his way home, and that he and all his retinue had
been killed. Then his father arose and said, “Verily the
Gods are good unto me, for they have visited his sins
upon himself alone;” and he immediately proceeded to
burn incense and return thanks. Some of his friends
would have persuaded him that the report was probably
untrue; but the old man had no doubts as to its correctness,
and made haste to get ready his son’s grave. But
Chia was not yet dead. In the fatal fourth moon he
had started on his journey and had fallen in with
bandits, to whom he had offered all his money and
valuables; upon which the latter cried out, “We have
come to avenge the cruel wrongs of many hundreds of
victims; do you imagine we want only <em>that?</em>” They
then cut off his head, and the head of his wicked secretary,
and the heads of several of his servants who had
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-78"><a id="Page_ii-78"></a></span>
been foremost in carrying out his shameful orders, and
were now accompanying him to the capital. They then
divided the booty between them, and made off with all
speed. Chia’s soul remained near his body for some
time, until at length a high mandarin passing by asked
who it was that was lying there dead. One of his
servants replied that he had been a magistrate at such
and such a place, and that his name was Pai. “What!”
said the mandarin, “the son of old Mr. Pai? It is hard
that his father should live to see such sorrow as this.
Put his head on again.”<a id="Anchor-414" title="Go to Footnote 414" href="#Footnote-414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> Then a man stepped forward
and placed Chia’s head upon his shoulders again, when
the mandarin interrupted him, saying, “A crooked-minded
man should not have a straight body: put his
head on sideways.” By-and-by Chia’s soul returned to
its tenement; and when his wife and children arrived to
take away the corpse, they found that he was still breathing.
Carrying him home, they poured some nourishment
down his throat, which he was able to swallow; but there
he was at an out-of-the-way place, without the means of
continuing his journey. It was some six months before
his father heard the real state of the case, and then he
sent off the second son to bring his brother home. Chia
had indeed come to life again, but he was able to see
down his own back, and was regarded ever afterwards
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-79"><a id="Page_ii-79"></a></span>
more as a monstrosity than as a man. Subsequently the
nephew, whom old Mr. Pai had seen sitting in state
surrounded by officials, actually became an Imperial
Censor, so that every detail of the dream was thus
strangely realised.<a id="Anchor-415" title="Go to Footnote 415" href="#Footnote-415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<br/>
THE UNJUST SENTENCE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Chu</span> was a native of Yang-ku, and, as a young
man, was much given to playing tricks and talking in a
loose kind of way. Having lost his wife, he went off to
ask a certain old woman to arrange another match for
him; and on the way, he chanced to fall in with a
neighbour’s wife who took his fancy very much. So he
said in joke to the old woman, “Get me that stylish-looking,
handsome lady, and I shall be quite satisfied.”
“I’ll see what I can do,” replied the old woman, also
joking, “if you will manage to kill her present husband;”
upon which Chu laughed and said he certainly
would do so. Now about a month afterwards, the said
husband, who had gone out to collect some money due
to him, was actually killed in a lonely spot; and the
magistrate of the district immediately summoned the
neighbours and beadle<a id="Anchor-416" title="Go to Footnote 416" href="#Footnote-416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> and held the usual inquest, but
was unable to find any clue to the murderer. However,
the old woman told the story of her conversation with
Chu, and suspicion at once fell upon him. The constables
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-81"><a id="Page_ii-81"></a></span>
came and arrested him; but he stoutly denied
the charge; and the magistrate now began to suspect the
wife of the murdered man. Accordingly, she was
severely beaten and tortured in several ways until her
strength failed her, and she falsely acknowledged her
guilt.<a id="Anchor-417" title="Go to Footnote 417" href="#Footnote-417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Chu was then examined, and he said, “This
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-82"><a id="Page_ii-82"></a></span>
delicate woman could not bear the agony of your tortures;
what she has stated is untrue; and, even should
her wrong escape the notice of the Gods, for her to die
in this way with a stain upon her name is more than I
can endure. I will tell the whole truth. I killed the
husband that I might secure the wife: she knew nothing
at all about it.” And when the magistrate asked for
some proof, Chu said his bloody clothes would be
evidence enough; but when they sent to search his
house, no bloody clothes were forthcoming. He was
then beaten till he fainted; yet when he came round he
still stuck to what he had said. “It is my mother,”
cried he, “who will not sign the death-warrant of her
son. Let me go myself and I will get the clothes.” So
he was escorted by a guard to his home, and there he
explained to his mother that whether she gave up or
withheld the clothes, it was all the same; that in either
case he would have to die, and it was better to die early
than late. Thereupon his mother wept bitterly, and
going into the bedroom, brought out, after a short delay,
the required clothes, which were taken at once to the
magistrate’s. There was now no doubt as to the truth of
Chu’s story; and as nothing occurred to change the
magistrate’s opinion, Chu was thrown into prison to
await the day for his execution. Meanwhile, as the
magistrate was one day inspecting his gaol, suddenly a
man appeared in the hall, who glared at him fiercely and
roared out, “Dull-headed fool! unfit to be the guardian
of the people’s interests!”&mdash;whereupon the crowd of servants
standing round rushed forward to seize him, but with
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-83"><a id="Page_ii-83"></a></span>
one sweep of his arms he laid them all flat on the ground.
The magistrate was frightened out of his wits, and tried
to escape, but the man cried out to him, “I am one of
Kuan Ti’s<a id="Anchor-418" title="Go to Footnote 418" href="#Footnote-418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> lieutenants. If you move an inch you are
lost.” So the magistrate stood there, shaking from head
to foot with fear, while his visitor continued, “The
murderer is Kung Piao: Chu had nothing to do with
it.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant then fell down on the ground, and
was to all appearance lifeless; however, after a while he
recovered, his face having quite changed, and when they
asked him his name, lo! it was Kung Piao. Under the
application of the bamboo he confessed his guilt.
Always an unprincipled man, he had heard that the
murdered man was going out to collect money, and
thinking he would be sure to bring it back with him, he
had killed him, but had found nothing. Then when he
learnt that Chu had acknowledged the crime as his own
doing, he had rejoiced in secret at such a stroke of luck.
How he had got into the magistrate’s hall he was quite
unable to say. The magistrate now called for some explanation
of Chu’s bloody clothes, which Chu himself
was unable to give; but his mother, who was at once
sent for, stated that she had cut her own arm to stain
them, and when they examined her they found on her
left arm the scar of a recent wound. The magistrate
was lost in amazement at all this; unfortunately for him
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-84"><a id="Page_ii-84"></a></span>
the reversal of his sentence cost him his appointment,
and he died in poverty, unable to find his way home.
As for Chu, the widow of the murdered man married
him<a id="Anchor-419" title="Go to Footnote 419" href="#Footnote-419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> in the following year, out of gratitude for his noble
behaviour.</p>

<p>[<span class="smallcaps">The</span> story runs that a Mr. Chia, after obtaining, with
the assistance of a mysterious friend, his master’s degree,
became alive to the vanity of mere earthly honours, and
determined to devote himself to the practice of Taoism,
in the hope of obtaining the elixir of immortality.<a id="Anchor-421" title="Go to Footnote 421" href="#Footnote-421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>]</p>

<p>So early one morning Chia and his friend, whose
name was Lang, stole away together, without letting
Chia’s family know anything about it; and by-and-by
they found themselves among the hills, in a vast cave
where there was another world and another sky. An old
man was sitting there in great state, and Lang presented
Chia to him as his future master. “Why have you come
so soon?” asked the old man; to which Lang replied,
“My friend’s determination is firmly fixed: I pray you
receive him amongst you.” “Since you have come,”
said the old man, turning to Chia, “you must begin by
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-86"><a id="Page_ii-86"></a></span>
putting away from you your earthly body.” Chia murmured
his assent, and was then escorted by Lang to
sleeping-chamber where he was provided with food,
after which Lang went away. The room was beautifully
clean:<a id="Anchor-422" title="Go to Footnote 422" href="#Footnote-422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> the doors had no panels and the windows no
lattices; and all the furniture was one table and one
couch. Chia took off his shoes and lay down, with the
moon shining brightly into the room; and beginning
soon to feel hungry, he tried one of the cakes on the
table, which he found sweet and very satisfying. He
thought Lang would be sure to come back, but there he
remained hour after hour by himself, never hearing a
sound. He noticed, however, that the room was fragrant
with a delicious perfume; his viscera seemed to be removed
from his body, by which his intellectual faculties
were much increased; and every one of his veins and
arteries could be easily counted. Then suddenly he
heard a sound like that of a cat scratching itself; and,
looking out of the window, he beheld a tiger sitting under
the verandah. He was horribly frightened for the
moment, but immediately recalling the admonition of
the old man, he collected himself and sat quietly down
again. The tiger seemed to know that there was a man
inside, for it entered the room directly afterwards, and
walking straight up to the couch sniffed at Chia’s feet.
Whereupon there was a noise outside, as if a fowl were
having its legs tied, and the tiger ran away. Shortly
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-87"><a id="Page_ii-87"></a></span>
afterwards a beautiful young girl came in, suffusing an
exquisite fragrance around; and going up to the couch
where Chia was, she bent over him and whispered,
“Here I am.” Her breath was like the sweet odour of
perfumes; but as Chia did not move, she whispered
again, “Are you sleeping?” The voice sounded to
Chia remarkably like that of his wife; however, he reflected
that these were all probably nothing more than
tests of his determination, so he closed his eyes firmly
for a while. But by-and-by the young lady called him
by his pet name, and then he opened his eyes wide to
discover that she was no other than his own wife. On
asking her how she had come there, she replied that Mr.
Lang was afraid her husband would be lonely, and had
sent an old woman to guide her to him. Just then they
heard the old man outside in a towering rage, and
Chia’s wife, not knowing where to conceal herself,
jumped over a low wall near by and disappeared. In
came the old man, and gave Lang a severe beating
before Chia’s face, bidding him at once to get rid of his
visitor; so Lang led Chia away over the low wall, saying,
“I knew how anxious you were to consummate your
immortality, and accordingly I tried to hurry things on
a bit; but now I see that your time has not yet come:
hence this beating I have had. Good-by: we shall meet
again some day.” He then shewed Chia the way to his
home, and waving his hand bade him farewell. Chia
looked down&mdash;for he was in the moon&mdash;and beheld the
old familiar village and recollecting that his wife was
not a good walker and would not have got very far,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-88"><a id="Page_ii-88"></a></span>
hurried on to overtake her. Before long he was at his
own door, but he noticed that the place was all tumble-down
and in ruins, and not as it was when he went away.
As for the people he saw, old and young alike, he did
not recognise one of them; and recollecting the story of
how Liu and Yüan came back from heaven,<a id="Anchor-423" title="Go to Footnote 423" href="#Footnote-423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> he was
afraid to go in at the door. So he sat down and rested
outside; and after a while an old man leaning on a staff
came out, whereupon Chia asked him which was the
house of Mr. Chia. “This is it,” replied the old man;
“you probably wish to hear the extraordinary story connected
with the family? I know all about it. They say
that Mr. Chia ran away just after he had taken his
master’s degree, when his son was only seven or eight
years old; and that about seven years afterwards the
child’s mother went into a deep sleep from which she
did not awake. As long as her son was alive he changed
his mother’s clothes for her according to the seasons, but
when he died, her grandsons fell into poverty, and had
nothing but an old shanty to put the sleeping lady into.
Last month she awaked, having been asleep for over a
hundred years. People from far and near have been
coming in great numbers to hear the strange story; of
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-89"><a id="Page_ii-89"></a></span>
late, however, there have been rather fewer.” Chia was
amazed when he heard all this, and, turning to the old
man, said, “I am Chia Fêng-chih.” This astonished the
old man very much, and off he went to make the announcement
to Chia’s family. The eldest grandson was
dead; and the second, a man of about fifty, refused to
believe that such a young-looking man was really his
grandfather; but in a few moments out came Chia’s
wife, and she recognised her husband at once. They
then fell upon each other’s necks and mingled their tears
together.</p>

<br/>
THE THREE STATES OF EXISTENCE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> man of the province of Hunan could
recall what had happened to him in three previous lives.
In the first, he was a magistrate; and, on one occasion,
when he had been nominated Assistant-Examiner,<a id="Anchor-425" title="Go to Footnote 425" href="#Footnote-425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> a
candidate, named Hsing, was unsuccessful. Hsing went
home dreadfully mortified, and soon after died; but his
spirit appeared before the King of Purgatory, and read
aloud the rejected essay, whereupon thousands of other
shades, all of whom had suffered in a similar way,
thronged around, and unanimously elected Hsing as
their chief. The Examiner was immediately summoned
to take his trial, and when he arrived the King asked
him, saying, “As you are appointed to examine the
various essays, how is it that you throw out the able
and admit the worthless?” “Sire,” replied he, “the
ultimate decision rests with the Grand Examiner; I
only pass them on to him.” The King then issued a
warrant for the apprehension of the Grand Examiner,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-91"><a id="Page_ii-91"></a></span>
and, as soon as he appeared, he was told what had
just now been said against him; to which he answered,
“I am only able to make a general estimate of the
merits of the candidates. Valuable essays may be kept
back from me by my Associate-Examiners, in which case
I am powerless.”<a id="Anchor-426" title="Go to Footnote 426" href="#Footnote-426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> But the King cried out, “It’s all very
well for you two thus to throw the blame on each other;
you are both guilty, and both of you must be bambooed
according to law.” This sentence was about to be
carried into effect, when Hsing, who was not at all
satisfied with its lack of severity, set up such a fearful
screeching and howling, in which he was well supported
by all the other hundreds and thousands of shades, that
the King stopped short, and inquired what was the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-92"><a id="Page_ii-92"></a></span>
matter. Thereupon Hsing informed His Majesty that
the sentence was too light, and that the Examiners
should both have their eyes gouged out, so as not to
be able to read essays any more. The King would
not consent to this, explaining to the noisy rabble
that the Examiners did not purposely reject good
essays, but only because they themselves were naturally
wanting in capacity. The shades then begged that, at
any rate, their hearts might be cut out, and to this
the King was obliged to yield; so the Examiners were
seized by the attendants, their garments stripped off,
and their bodies ripped open with sharp knives. The
blood poured out on the ground, and the victims
screamed with pain; at which all the shades rejoiced
exceedingly, and said, “Here we have been pent up,
with no one to redress our wrongs; but now Mr. Hsing
has come, our injuries are washed away.” They then
dispersed with great noise and hubbub. As for our
Associate-Examiner, after his heart had been cut out, he
came to life again as the son of a poor man in Shensi;
and when he was twenty years old he fell into the hands
of the rebels, who were at that time giving great trouble to
the country. By-and-by, a certain official was sent at the
head of some soldiers to put down the insurrection, and
he succeeded in capturing a large number of the rebels,
among whom was our hero. The latter reflected that he
himself was no rebel, and he was hoping that he would
be able to obtain his release in consequence, when he
noticed that the officer in charge was also a man of his
own age, and, on looking more closely, he saw that it
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-93"><a id="Page_ii-93"></a></span>
was his old enemy, Hsing. “Alas!” cried he, “such
is destiny;” and so indeed it turned out, for all the
other prisoners were forthwith released, and he alone
was beheaded. Once more his spirit stood before the
King of Purgatory, this time with an accusation against
Hsing. The King, however, would not summon Hsing
at once, but said he should be allowed to complete his
term of official life on earth; and it was not till thirty
years afterwards that Hsing appeared to answer to the
charge. Then, because he had made light of the lives
of his people, he was condemned to be born again as a
brute-beast; and our hero, too, inasmuch as he had
been known to beat his father and mother, was sentenced
to a similar fate. The latter, fearing the future
vengeance of Hsing, persuaded the King to give him
the advantage of size; and, accordingly, orders were
issued that he was to be born again as a big, and
Hsing as a little, dog. The big dog came to life in a
shop in Shun-t‘ien Fu, and was one day lying down in
the street, when a trader from the south arrived,
bringing with him a little golden-haired dog, about the
size of a wild cat, which, lo and behold! turned out to
be Hsing. The other, thinking Hsing’s size would
render him an easy prey, seized him at once; but the
little one caught him from underneath by the throat,
and hung there firmly, like a bell. The big dog tried
hard to shake him off, and the people of the shop did
their best to separate them, but all was of no avail, and
in a few moments both dogs were dead. Upon their
spirits presenting themselves, as usual, before the King,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-94"><a id="Page_ii-94"></a></span>
each with its grievance against the other, the King cried
out, “When will ye have done with your wrongs and
your animosities? I will now settle the matter finally
for you;” and immediately commanded that Hsing
should become the other’s son-in-law in the next world.
The latter was then born at Ch‘ing-yün, and when he
was twenty-eight years of age took his master’s degree.
He had one daughter, a very pretty girl, whom many of
his wealthy neighbours would have been glad to get for
their sons; but he would not accept any of their
offers. On one occasion, he happened to pass through
the prefectural city just as the examination for bachelor’s
degree was over; and the candidate who had come out
at the top of the list, though named Li, was no other
than Mr. Hsing. So he led this man away, and took
him to an inn, where he treated him with the utmost
cordiality, finally arranging that, as Mr. Li was still
unmarried, he should marry his pretty daughter. Everyone,
of course, thought that this was done in admiration
of Li’s talents, ignorant that destiny had already decreed
the union of the young couple. No sooner were they
married than Li, proud of his own literary achievements,
began to slight his father-in-law, and often passed many
months without going near him; all of which the
father-in-law bore very patiently, and when, at length,
Li had repeatedly failed to get on any farther in his
career, he even went so far as to set to work, by all
manner of means, to secure his success; after which they
lived happily together as father and son.</p>

<br/>
IN THE INFERNAL REGIONS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Hsi Fang-p‘ing</span> was a native of Tung-an. His
father’s name was Hsi Lien&mdash;a hasty-tempered man,
who had quarrelled with a neighbour named Yang.
By-and-by Yang died: and some years afterwards when
Lien was on his death-bed, he cried out that Yang
was bribing the devils in hell to torture him. His
body then swelled up and turned red, and in a few moments
he had breathed his last. His son wept bitterly,
and refused all food, saying, “Alas! my poor father is
now being maltreated by cruel devils; I must go down
and help to redress his wrongs.” Thereupon he ceased
speaking, and sat for a long time like one dazed, his
soul having already quitted its tenement of clay. To
himself he appeared to be outside the house, not
knowing in what direction to go, so he inquired from
one of the passers-by which was the way to the district
city.<a id="Anchor-427" title="Go to Footnote 427" href="#Footnote-427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Before long he found himself there, and, directing
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-96"><a id="Page_ii-96"></a></span>
his steps towards the prison, found his father lying
outside<a id="Anchor-428" title="Go to Footnote 428" href="#Footnote-428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> in a very shocking state. When the latter
beheld his son, he burst into tears, and declared that
the gaolers had been bribed to beat him, which they
did both day and night, until they had reduced him to
his present sorry plight. Then Fang-p‘ing turned round
in a great rage, and began to curse the gaolers. “Out
upon you!” cried he; “if my father is guilty he should
be punished according to law, and not at the will of a
set of scoundrels like you.” Thereupon he hurried
away, and prepared a petition, which he took with him
to present at the morning session of the City God; but
his enemy, Yang, had meanwhile set to work, and
bribed so effectually, that the City God dismissed his
petition for want of corroborative evidence.<a id="Anchor-429" title="Go to Footnote 429" href="#Footnote-429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Fang-p‘ing
was furious, but could do nothing; so he started at
once for the prefectural city, where he managed to get
his plaint received, though it was nearly a month before
it came on for hearing, and then all he got was a
reference back to the district city, where he was severely
tortured, and escorted back to the door of his own
home, for fear he should give further trouble. However,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-97"><a id="Page_ii-97"></a></span>
he did not go in, but stole away and proceeded
to lay his complaint before one of the ten Judges of
Purgatory; whereupon the two mandarins who had
previously ill-used him, came forward and secretly offered
him a thousand ounces of silver if he would withdraw
the charge. This he positively refused to do; and some
days subsequently the landlord of the inn, where he was
staying, told him he had been a fool for his pains, and
that he would now get neither money nor justice, the
Judge himself having already been tampered with.
Fang-p‘ing thought this was mere gossip, and would
not believe it; but, when his case was called, the Judge
utterly refused to hear the charge, and ordered him
twenty blows with the bamboo, which were administered
in spite of all his protestations. He then cried out,
“Ah! it’s all because I have no money to give you;”
which so incensed the Judge, that he told the lictors to
throw Fang-p‘ing on the fire-bed. This was a great
iron couch, with a roaring fire underneath, which made
it red-hot; and upon that the devils cast Fang-p‘ing,
having first stripped off his clothes, pressing him down
on it, until the fire ate into his very bones, though in
spite of that he could not die. After a while the devils
said he had had enough, and made him get off the iron
bed, and put his clothes on again. He was just able
to walk, and when he went back into court, the Judge
asked him if he wanted to make any further complaints.
“Alas!” cried he, “my wrongs are still unredressed,
and I should only be lying were I to say I would
complain no more.” The Judge then inquired what he
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-98"><a id="Page_ii-98"></a></span>
had to complain of; to which Fang-p‘ing replied that it
was of the injustice of his recent punishment. This
enraged the Judge so much that he ordered his attendants
to saw Fang-p‘ing in two. He was then led away
by devils, to a place where he was thrust in between a
couple of wooden boards, the ground on all sides being
wet and sticky with blood. Just at that moment he
was summoned to return before the Judge, who asked
him if he was still of the same mind; and, on his
replying in the affirmative, he was taken back again,
and bound between the two boards. The saw was then
applied, and as it went through his brain he experienced
the most cruel agonies, which, however, he managed to
endure without uttering a cry. “He’s a tough customer,”
said one of the devils, as the saw made its
way gradually through his chest; to which the other
replied, “Truly, this is filial piety; and, as the poor
fellow has done nothing, let us turn the saw a little out
of the direct line, so as to avoid injuring his heart.”
Fang-p‘ing then felt the saw make a curve inside him,
which caused him even more pain than before; and, in
a few moments, he was cut through right down to the
ground, and the two halves of his body fell apart, along
with the boards to which they were tied, one on either
side. The devils went back to report progress, and
were then ordered to join Fang-p‘ing together again,
and bring him in. This they accordingly did,&mdash;the cut
all down Fang-p‘ing’s body hurting him dreadfully, and
feeling as if it would re-open every minute. But, as
Fang-p‘ing was unable to walk, one of the devils took
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-99"><a id="Page_ii-99"></a></span>
out a cord and tied it round his waist, as a reward, he
said, for his filial piety. The pain immediately ceased,
and Fang-p‘ing appeared once more before the Judge,
this time promising that he would make no more complaints.
The Judge now gave orders that he should be
sent up to earth, and the devils, escorting him out of
the north gate of the city, shewed him his way home,
and went away. Fang-p‘ing now saw that there was
even less chance of securing justice in the Infernal
Regions than upon the earth above; and, having no
means of getting at the Great King to plead his case,
he bethought himself of a certain upright and benevolent
God, called Erh Lang, who was a relative of the
Great King’s, and him he determined to seek. So he
turned about and took his way southwards, but was
immediately seized by some devils, sent out by the
Judge to watch that he really went back to his home.
These devils hurried him again into the Judge’s presence,
where he was received, contrary to his expectation,
with great affability; the Judge himself praising
his filial piety, but declaring that he need trouble no
further in the matter, as his father had already been
born again in a wealthy and illustrious family. “And
upon you,” added the Judge, “I now bestow a present
of one thousand ounces of silver to take home with you,
as well as the old age of a centenarian, with which I
hope you will be satisfied.” He then shewed Fang-p‘ing
the stamped record of this, and sent him away in charge
of the devils. The latter now began to abuse him for
giving them so much trouble, but Fang-p‘ing turned
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-100"><a id="Page_ii-100"></a></span>
sharply upon them, and threatened to take them back
before the Judge. They were then silent, and marched
along for about half-a-day, until at length they reached a
village, where the devils invited Fang-p‘ing into a house,
the door of which was standing half-open. Fang-p‘ing
was just going in, when suddenly the devils gave him a
shove from behind, and ... there he was, born
again on earth as a little girl. For three days he pined
and cried, without taking any food, and then he died.
But his spirit did not forget Erh Lang, and set out at
once in search of that God. He had not gone far when
he fell in with the retinue of some high personage,
and one of the attendants seized him for getting in the
way, and hurried him before his master. He was taken
to a chariot, where he saw a handsome young man,
sitting in great state; and thinking that now was his
chance, he told the young man, who he imagined to be
a high mandarin, all his sad story from beginning to
end. His bonds were then loosed, and he went along
with the young man until they reached a place where
several officials came out to receive them; and to one
of these he confided Fang-p‘ing, who now learnt that
the young man was no other than God himself, the
officials being the nine princes of heaven, and the one
to whose care he was entrusted no other than Erh Lang.
This last was very tall, and had a long white beard, not
at all like the popular representation of a God; and
when the other princes had gone, he took Fang-p‘ing
into a court-room, where he saw his father and their old
enemy, Yang, besides all the lictors and others who had
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-101"><a id="Page_ii-101"></a></span>
been mixed up in the case. By-and-by, some criminals
were brought in in cages, and these turned out to be
the Judge, Prefect, and Magistrate. The trial was then
commenced, the three wicked officers trembling and
shaking in their shoes; and when he had heard the
evidence, Erh Lang proceeded to pass sentence upon
the prisoners, each of whom he sentenced, after enlarging
upon the enormity of their several crimes, to
be roasted, boiled, and otherwise put to most excruciating
tortures. As for Fang-p‘ing, he accorded him
three extra decades of life, as a reward for his filial
piety, and a copy of the sentence was put in his pocket.
Father and son journeyed along together, and at length
reached their home; that is to say, Fang-p‘ing was the
first to recover consciousness, and then bade the servants
open his father’s coffin, which they immediately
did, and the old man at once came back to life. But
when Fang-p‘ing looked for his copy of the sentence,
lo! it had disappeared. As for the Yang family,
poverty soon overtook them, and all their lands passed
into Fang-p‘ing’s hands; for as sure as any one else
bought them, they became sterile forthwith, and would
produce nothing; but Fang-p‘ing and his father lived
on happily, both reaching the age of ninety and odd
years.<a id="Anchor-430" title="Go to Footnote 430" href="#Footnote-430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<br/>
SINGULAR CASE OF OPHTHALMIA.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A Mr. Ku</span>, of Chiang-nan, was stopping in an inn
at Chi-hsia, when he was attacked by a very severe
inflammation of the eyes. Day and night he lay on his
bed groaning, no medicines being of any avail; and
when he did get a little better, his recovery was accompanied
by a singular phenomenon. Every time he
closed his eyes, he beheld in front of him a number of
large buildings, with all their doors wide open, and
people passing and repassing in the background, none
of whom he recognised by sight. One day he had just
sat down to have a good look, when, all of a sudden, he
felt himself passing through the open doors. He went
on through three court-yards without meeting any one;
but, on looking into some rooms on either side, he saw
a great number of young girls sitting, lying, and kneeling
about on a red carpet, which was spread on the
ground. Just then a man came out from behind the
building, and, seeing Ku, said to him, “Ah, the Prince
said there was a stranger at the door; I suppose you
are the person he meant.” He then asked Ku to walk
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-103"><a id="Page_ii-103"></a></span>
in, which the latter was at first unwilling to do; however,
he yielded to the man’s instances, and accompanied
him in, asking whose palace it was. His
guide told him it belonged to the son of the Ninth
Prince, and that he had arrived at the nick of time,
for a number of friends and relatives had chosen this
very day to come and congratulate the young gentleman
on his recent recovery from a severe illness. Meanwhile
another person had come out to hurry them on, and they
soon reached a spot where there was a pavilion facing
the north, with an ornamental terrace and red balustrades,
supported by nine pillars. Ascending the
steps, they found the place full of visitors, and then
espied a young man seated with his face to the north,<a id="Anchor-431" title="Go to Footnote 431" href="#Footnote-431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
whom they at once knew to be the Prince’s son, and
thereupon they prostrated themselves before him, the
whole company rising as they did so. The young
Prince made Ku sit down to the east of him, and
caused wine to be served; after which some singing-girls
came in and performed the Hua-fêng-chu.<a id="Anchor-432" title="Go to Footnote 432" href="#Footnote-432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> They
had got to about the third scene, when, all of a sudden,
Ku heard the landlord of the inn and his servant
shouting out to him that dinner was ready, and was
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-104"><a id="Page_ii-104"></a></span>
dreadfully afraid that the young Prince, too, had heard.
No one, however, seemed to have noticed anything,
so Ku begged to be excused a moment, as he wished to
change his clothes, and immediately ran out. He then
looked up, and saw the sun low in the west, and his
servant standing by his bedside, whereupon he knew
that he had never left the inn. He was much chagrined
at this, and wished to go back as fast as he
could; he, therefore, dismissed his servant, and on
shutting his eyes once more, he found everything just
as he had left it, except that where, on the first
occasion, he had observed the young girls, there were
none now to be seen, but only some dishevelled hump-backed
creatures, who cried out at him, and asked him
what he meant by spying about there. Ku didn’t dare
reply, but hurried past them as quickly as he could,
and on to the pavilion of the young Prince. There he
found him still sitting, but with a black beard over a
foot in length; and the Prince was anxious to know
where he had been, saying that seven scenes of the
play were already over. He then seized a big goblet
of wine, and made Ku drink it as a penalty, by which
time the play was finished, and the list was handed up
for a further selection. The “Marriage of P‘êng Tsu”
was selected, and then the singing-girls began to hand
round the wine in cocoa-nuts big enough to hold about
five quarts, which Ku declined, on the ground that he
was suffering from weak eyes, and was consequently
afraid to drink too much. “If your eyes are bad,”
cried the young Prince, “the Court physician is at hand,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-105"><a id="Page_ii-105"></a></span>
and can attend to you.” Thereupon, one of the guests
sitting to the east came forward, and opening Ku’s
eyes with his fingers, touched them with some white
ointment, which he applied from the end of a jade
pin. He then bade Ku close his eyes, and take a
short nap; so the Prince had him conducted into a
sleeping-room, where he found the bed so soft, and
surrounded by such delicious perfume, that he soon
fell into a deep slumber. By-and-by he was awaked
by what appeared to be the clashing of cymbals, and
fancied that the play was still going on; but on opening
his eyes, he saw that it was only the inn-dog, which was
licking an oilman’s gong.<a id="Anchor-433" title="Go to Footnote 433" href="#Footnote-433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> His ophthalmia, however,
was quite cured; and when he shut his eyes again he
could see nothing.</p>

CHOU K‘O-CH‘ANG AND HIS GHOST.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Huai-shang there lived a graduate named Chou
T‘ien-i, who, though fifty years of age, had but one son,
called K‘o-ch‘ang, whom he loved very dearly. This
boy, when about thirteen or fourteen, was a handsome,
well-favoured fellow, strangely averse to study, and often
playing truant from school, sometimes for the whole day,
without any remonstrance on the part of his father. One
day he went away and did not come back in the evening;
neither, after a diligent search, could any traces of
him be discovered. His father and mother were in
despair, and hardly cared to live; but after a year and
more had passed away, lo and behold! K‘o-ch‘ang returned,
saying that he had been beguiled away by a
Taoist priest, who, however, had not done him any
harm, and that he had seized a moment while the priest
was absent to escape and find his way home again. His
father was delighted, and asked him no more questions,
but set to work to give him an education; and K‘o-ch‘ang
was so much cleverer and more intelligent than he had
been before, that by the following year he had taken his
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-107"><a id="Page_ii-107"></a></span>
bachelor’s degree and had made quite a name for himself.
Immediately all the good families of the neighbourhood
wanted to secure him as a son-in-law. Among
others proposed there was an extremely nice girl, the
daughter of a gentleman named Chao, who had taken
his doctor’s degree, and K‘o-ch‘ang’s father was very
anxious that he should marry the young lady. The
youth himself would not hear of it, but stuck to his
books and took his master’s degree, quite refusing to entertain
any thought of marriage; and this so exasperated
his mother that one day the good lady began to rate him
soundly. K‘o-ch‘ang got up in a great rage and cried
out, “I have long been wanting to get away, and have
only remained for your sakes. I shall now say farewell,
and leave Miss Chao for any one that likes to marry her.”
At this his mother tried to detain him, but in a moment
he had fallen forwards on the ground, and there was
nothing left of him but his hat and clothes. They were
all dreadfully frightened, thinking that it must have been
K‘o-ch‘ang’s ghost who had been with them, and gave
themselves up to weeping and lamentation; however, the
very next day K‘o-ch‘ang arrived, accompanied by a
retinue of horses and servants, his story being that he
had formerly been kidnapped<a id="Anchor-434" title="Go to Footnote 434" href="#Footnote-434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> and sold to a wealthy
trader, who, being then childless, had adopted him, but
who, when he subsequently had a son born to him by his
own wife, sent K‘o-ch‘ang back to his old home. And
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-108"><a id="Page_ii-108"></a></span>
as soon as his father began to question him as to his
studies, his utter dulness and want of knowledge soon
made it clear that he was the real K‘o-ch‘ang of old; but
he was already known as a man who had got his master’s
degree, (that is, the ghost of him had got it,) so it was
determined in the family to keep the whole affair secret.
This K‘o-ch‘ang was only too ready to espouse Miss
Chao; and before a year had passed over their heads
his wife had presented the old people with the much
longed-for grandson.</p>

THE SPIRITS OF THE PO-YANG LAKE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">An</span> official, named Chai, was appointed to a post at
Jao-chou, and on his way thither crossed the Po-yang
lake. Happening to visit the shrine of the local spirits,
he noticed a carved image of the patriotic Ting P‘u-lang,<a id="Anchor-435" title="Go to Footnote 435" href="#Footnote-435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
and another of a namesake of his own, the latter occupying
a very inferior position. “Come! come!” said
Chai, “my patron saint shan’t be put in the background
like that;” so he moved the image into a more honourable
place, and then went back on board his boat again.
Soon after, a great wind struck the vessel, and carried
away the mast and sails; at which the sailors, in great
alarm, set to work to howl and cry. However, in a few
moments they saw a small skiff come cutting through the
waves, and before long they were all safely on board.
The man who rowed it was strangely like the image in
the shrine, the position of which Chai had changed;
but they were hardly out of danger when the squall had
passed over, and skiff and man had both vanished.</p>

flowing by, two or three feet in breadth and of about the
same depth. He immediately seized two large handfuls,

THE INJUSTICE OF HEAVEN.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Hsü</span> was a magistrate at Shantung. A certain
upper chamber of his house was used as a store-room;
but some creature managed so frequently to get in and
make havoc among the stores, for which the servants
were always being scolded, that at length some of the
latter determined to keep watch. By-and-by they saw a
huge spider as big as a peck measure, and hurried off to
tell their master, who thought it so strange that he gave
orders to the servants to feed the insect with cakes. It
thus became very tame, and would always come forth
when hungry, returning as soon as it had taken enough
to eat.<a id="Anchor-438" title="Go to Footnote 438" href="#Footnote-438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> Years passed away, and one day Mr. Hsü
was consulting his archives, when suddenly the spider
appeared and ran under the table. Thinking it was
hungry, he bade his servants give it a cake; but the
next moment he noticed two snakes, of about the thickness
of a chop-stick, lying one on each side. The spider
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-112"><a id="Page_ii-112"></a></span>
drew in its legs as if in mortal fear, and the snakes began
to swell out until they were as big round as an egg; at
which Mr. Hsü was greatly alarmed, and would have
hurried away, when crash! went a peal of thunder,
killing every person in the house. Mr. Hsü himself recovered
consciousness after a little while, but only to see
his wife and servants, seven persons in all, lying dead;
and after a month’s illness he, too, departed this life.
Now Mr. Hsü was an upright, honourable man, who
really had the interests of the people at heart. A subscription
was accordingly raised to pay his funeral
expenses, and on the day of his burial the air was rent
for miles round with cries of weeping and lamentation.</p>

seas, when one night it suddenly became as light as day
on board his ship. Jumping up to see what was the
matter, he beheld a huge creature with its body half out

two suns, and threw a light far and wide; and when the
trader asked the boatmen what it was, there was not one
who could say. They all crouched down and watched
it; and by-and-by the monster gradually disappeared in
the water again, leaving everything in darkness as before.
And when they reached port, they found all the people
talking about a strange phenomenon of a great light that

<p>“... <span class="smallcaps">But</span> if you would really like to have something
that has belonged to me,” said she, “you shall.”
Whereupon she took out a mirror and gave it to him,
saying, “Whenever you want to see me, you must look
for me in your books; otherwise I shall not be visible;”&mdash;and
in a moment she had vanished. Liu went home
very melancholy at heart; but when he looked in the
mirror, there was Fêng-hsien, standing with her back to
him, gazing, as it were, at some one who was going away,
and about a hundred paces from her. He then bethought
himself of her injunctions, and settled down to
his studies, refusing to receive any visitors; and a few
days subsequently, when he happened to look in the
mirror, there was Fêng-hsien, with her face turned towards
him, and smiling in every feature. After this, he
was always taking out the mirror to look at her; however,
in about a month his good resolutions began to
disappear, and he once more went out to enjoy himself
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-115"><a id="Page_ii-115"></a></span>
and waste his time as before. When he returned home
and looked in the mirror, Fêng-hsien seemed to be
crying bitterly; and the day after, when he looked at her
again, she had her back turned towards him as on the
day he received the mirror. He now knew that it was
because he had neglected his studies, and forthwith set
to work again with all diligence, until in a month’s time
she had turned round once again. Henceforward, whenever
anything interrupted his progress, Fêng-hsien’s
countenance became sad; but whenever he was getting
on well, her sadness was changed to smiles. Night and
morning Liu would look at the mirror, regarding it quite
in the light of a revered preceptor; and in three years’
time he took his degree in triumph. “Now,” cried he,
“I shall be able to look Fêng-hsien in the face.” And
there, sure enough, she was, with her delicately-pencilled
arched eye-brows, and her teeth just showing between
her lips, as happy-looking as she could be, when, all of a
sudden, she seemed to speak, and Liu heard her say,
“A pretty pair we make, I must allow”&mdash;and the next
moment Fêng-hsien stood by his side.</p>

<br/>
COURAGE TESTED.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Tung</span> was a Hsü-chou man, very fond of playing
broad-sword, and a light-hearted, devil-may-care fellow,
who was often involving himself in trouble. One day he
fell in with a traveller who was riding on a mule and
going the same way as himself; whereupon they entered
into conversation, and began to talk to each other about
feats of strength and so on. The traveller said his name
was T‘ung,<a id="Anchor-443" title="Go to Footnote 443" href="#Footnote-443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> and that he belonged to Liao-yang; that he
had been twenty years away from home, and had just
returned from beyond the sea. “And I venture to say,”
cried Tung, “that in your wanderings on the Four Seas<a id="Anchor-444" title="Go to Footnote 444" href="#Footnote-444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-117"><a id="Page_ii-117"></a></span>
you have seen a great many people; but have you seen
any supernaturally clever ones?” T‘ung asked him to
what he alluded; and then Tung explained what his own
particular hobby was, adding how much he would like to
learn from them any tricks in the art of broad-sword.
“Supernatural,” replied the traveller, “are to be found
everywhere. It needs but that a man should be a loyal
subject and a filial son for him to know all that the
supernaturals know.” “Right you are, indeed!” cried
Tung, as he drew a short sword from his belt, and,
tapping the blade with his fingers, began to accompany
it with a song. He then cut down a tree that was by
the wayside, to shew T‘ung how sharp it was; at which
T‘ung smoothed his beard and smiled, begging to be
allowed to have a look at the weapon. Tung handed it
to him, and, when he had turned it over two or three
times, he said, “This is a very inferior piece of steel;
now, though I know nothing about broad-sword myself,
I have a weapon which is really of some use.” He then
drew from beneath his coat a sword of a foot or so in
length, and with it he began to pare pieces off Tung’s
sword, which seemed as soft as a melon, and which he
cut quite away like a horse’s hoof. Tung was greatly
astonished, and borrowed the other’s sword to examine
it, returning it after carefully wiping the blade. He then
invited T‘ung to his house, and made him stay the night;
and, after begging him to explain the mystery of his
sword, began to nurse his leg and sit listening respectfully
without saying a word. It was already pretty late,
when suddenly there was a sound of scuffling next door,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-118"><a id="Page_ii-118"></a></span>
where Tung’s father lived; and, on putting his ear to the
wall, he heard an angry voice saying, “Tell your son to
come here at once, and then I will spare you.” This
was followed by other sounds of beating and a continued
groaning, in a voice which Tung knew to be his father’s.
He therefore seized a spear, and was about to rush forth,
but T‘ung held him back, saying, “You’ll be killed for a
certainty if you go. Let us think of some other plan.”
Tung asked what plan he could suggest; to which the
other replied, “The robbers are killing your father:
there is no help for you; but as you have no brothers,
just go and tell your wife and children what your last
wishes are, while I try and rouse the servants.” Tung
agreed to this, and ran in to tell his wife, who clung to
him and implored him not to go, until at length all his
courage had ebbed away, and he went upstairs with her
to get his bow and arrows ready to resist the robbers’
attack. At that juncture he heard the voice of his friend
T‘ung, outside on the eaves of the house, saying, with a
laugh, “All right; the robbers have gone;” but on
lighting a candle, he could see nothing of him. He
then stole out to the front door, where he met his father
with a lantern in his hand, coming in from a party at a
neighbour’s house; and the whole court-yard was covered
with the ashes of burnt grass, whereby he knew that
T‘ung the traveller was himself a supernatural.<a id="Anchor-445" title="Go to Footnote 445" href="#Footnote-445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<br/>
THE DISEMBODIED FRIEND.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Ch‘ên</span>, <abbr title="Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr>, of Shun-t‘ien Fu, when a boy of
sixteen, went to school at a Buddhist temple.<a id="Anchor-446" title="Go to Footnote 446" href="#Footnote-446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> There
were a great many scholars besides himself, and, among
others, one named Ch‘u, who said he came from Shantung.
This Ch‘u was a very hard-working fellow; he
never seemed to be idle, and actually slept in the school-room,
not going home at all. Ch‘ên became much
attached to him, and one day asked him why he never
went away. “Well, you see,” replied Ch‘u, “my
people are very poor, and can hardly afford to pay for
my schooling; but, by dint of working half the night,
two of my days are equal to three of anybody else’s.”
Thereupon Ch‘ên said he would bring his own bed to
the school, and that they would sleep there together; to
which Ch‘u replied that the teaching they got wasn’t
worth much, and that they would do better by putting
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-120"><a id="Page_ii-120"></a></span>
themselves under a certain old scholar named Lü. This
they were easily able to do, as the arrangement at the
temple was monthly, and at the end of each month anyone
was free to go or to come. So off they went to this
Mr. Lü, a man of considerable literary attainments, who
had found himself in Shun-t‘ien Fu without a cash in his
pocket, and was accordingly obliged to take pupils. He
was delighted at getting two additions to his number
and, Ch‘u showing himself an apt scholar, the two soon
became very great friends, sleeping in the same room and
eating at the same table. At the end of the month Ch‘u
asked for leave of absence, and, to the astonishment of
all, ten days elapsed without anything being heard of
him. It then chanced that Ch‘ên went to the T‘ien-ning
temple, and there he saw Ch‘u under one of the verandahs,
occupied in cutting wood for lucifer-matches.<a id="Anchor-447" title="Go to Footnote 447" href="#Footnote-447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
The latter was much disconcerted by the arrival of
Ch‘ên, who asked him why he had given up his studies;
so the latter took him aside, and explained that he was
so poor as to be obliged to work half a month to scrape
together funds enough for his next month’s schooling.
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-121"><a id="Page_ii-121"></a></span>
“You come along back with me,” cried Ch‘ên, on hearing
this, “I will arrange for the payment,” which Ch‘u immediately
consented to do on condition that Ch‘ên would
keep the whole thing a profound secret. Now Ch‘ên’s
father was a wealthy tradesman, and from his till Ch‘ên
abstracted money wherewith to pay for Ch‘u; and by-and-by,
when his father found him out, he confessed why
he had done so. Thereupon Ch‘ên’s father called him a
fool, and would not let him resume his studies; at which
Ch‘u was much hurt, and would have left the school too,
but that old Mr. Lü discovered what had taken place, and
gave him the money to return to Ch‘ên’s father, keeping
him still at the school, and treating him quite like his
own son. So Ch‘ên studied no more, but whenever he
met Ch‘u he always asked him to join in some refreshment
at a restaurant, Ch‘u invariably refusing, but
yielding at length to his entreaties, being himself loth to
break off their old acquaintanceship.</p>

<p>Thus two years passed away, when Ch‘ên’s father died,
and Ch‘ên went back to his books under the guidance of
old Mr. Lü, who was very glad to see such determination.
Of course Ch‘ên was now far behind Ch‘u;
and in about six months Lü’s son arrived, having begged
his way in search of his father, so Mr. Lü gave up his
school and returned home with a purse which his pupils
had made up for him, Ch‘u adding nothing thereto but
his tears. At parting, Mr. Lü advised Ch‘ên to take
Ch‘u as his tutor, and this he did, establishing him comfortably
in the house with him. The examination was
very shortly to commence, and Ch‘ên felt convinced that
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-122"><a id="Page_ii-122"></a></span>
he should not get through; but Ch‘u said he thought he
should be able to manage the matter for him. On the
appointed day he introduced Ch‘ên to a gentleman who
he said was a cousin of his, named Liu, and asked
Ch‘ên to accompany this cousin, which Ch‘ên was just
proceeding to do when Ch‘u pulled him back from behind,<a id="Anchor-448" title="Go to Footnote 448" href="#Footnote-448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
and he would have fallen down but that the
cousin pulled him up again, and then, after having
scrutinized his appearance, carried him off to his own
house. There being no ladies there, Ch‘ên was put into
the inner apartments; and a few days afterwards Liu
said to him, “A great many people will be at the
gardens to-day; let us go and amuse ourselves awhile,
and afterwards I will send you home again.” He then gave
orders that a servant should proceed on ahead with tea
and wine, and by-and-by they themselves went, and were
soon in the thick of the fête. Crossing over a bridge,
they saw beneath an old willow tree a little painted skiff,
and were soon on board, engaged in freely passing round
the wine. However, finding this a little dull, Liu bade
his servant go and see if Miss Li, the famous singing-girl,
was at home; and in a few minutes the servant
returned bringing Miss Li with him. Ch‘ên had met her
before, and so they at once exchanged greetings, while
Liu begged her to be good enough to favour them with a
song. Miss Li, who seemed labouring under a fit of
melancholy, forthwith began a funeral dirge; at which
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-123"><a id="Page_ii-123"></a></span>
Ch‘ên was not much pleased, and observed that such a
theme was hardly suitable to the occasion. With a
forced smile, Miss Li changed her key, and gave them a
love-song; whereupon Ch‘ên seized her hand, and said,
“There’s that song of the Huan-sha river,<a id="Anchor-449" title="Go to Footnote 449" href="#Footnote-449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> which you
sang once before; I have read it over several times, but
have quite forgotten the words.” Then Miss Li <span class="nowrap">began&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse_i-0-5">“Eyes overflowing with tears, she sits gazing into her glass,</div>
<div class="verse_i0">Lifting the bamboo screen, one of her comrades approaches;</div>
<div class="verse_i0">She bends her head and seems intent on her bow-like slippers,</div>
<div class="verse_i0">And forces her eyebrows to arch themselves into a smile.</div>
<div class="verse_i0">With her scarlet sleeve she wipes the tears from her perfumed cheek,</div>

     o’erwhelm her.”<a id="Anchor-450" title="Go to Footnote 450" href="#Footnote-450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>Ch‘ên repeated this over several times, until at length
the skiff stopped, and they passed through a long verandah,
where a great many verses had been inscribed on
the walls,<a id="Anchor-451" title="Go to Footnote 451" href="#Footnote-451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> to which Ch‘ên at once proceeded to add a
stanza of his own. Evening was now coming on, and
Liu remarked that the candidates would be just about
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-124"><a id="Page_ii-124"></a></span>
leaving the examination-hall;<a id="Anchor-452" title="Go to Footnote 452" href="#Footnote-452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> so he escorted him back
to his own home, and there left him. The room was
dark, and there was no one with him; but by-and-by the
servants ushered in some one whom at first he took to
be Ch‘u. However, he soon saw that it was not Ch‘u,
and in another moment the stranger had fallen against
him and knocked him down. “Master’s fainted!”
cried the servants, as they ran to pick him up; and then
Ch‘ên discovered that the one who had fallen down was
really no other than himself.<a id="Anchor-453" title="Go to Footnote 453" href="#Footnote-453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> On getting up, he saw
Ch‘u standing by his side; and when they had sent away
the servants the latter said, “Don’t be alarmed: I am
nothing more than a disembodied spirit. My time for
re-appearing on earth<a id="Anchor-454" title="Go to Footnote 454" href="#Footnote-454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> is long overdue, but I could not
forget your great kindness to me, and accordingly I have
remained under this form in order to assist in the accomplishment
of your wishes. The three bouts<a id="Anchor-455" title="Go to Footnote 455" href="#Footnote-455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> are over, and
your ambition will be gratified.” Ch‘ên then inquired if
Ch‘u could assist him in like manner for his doctor’s
degree; to which the latter replied, “Alas! the luck
descending to you from your ancestors is not equal to
that.<a id="Anchor-456" title="Go to Footnote 456" href="#Footnote-456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> They were a niggardly lot, and unfit for the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-125"><a id="Page_ii-125"></a></span>
posthumous honours you would thus confer on them.”
Ch‘ên next asked him whither he was going; and Ch‘u
replied that he hoped, through the agency of his cousin,
who was a clerk in Purgatory, to be born again in old
Mr. Lü’s family. They then bade each other adieu;
and, when morning came, Ch‘ên set off to call on Miss
Li, the singing-girl; but on reaching her house he found
that she had been dead some days.<a id="Anchor-457" title="Go to Footnote 457" href="#Footnote-457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> He walked on to
the gardens, and there he saw traces of verses that had
been written on the walls, and evidently rubbed out, so
as to be hardly decipherable. In a moment it flashed
across him that the verses and their composers
belonged to the other world. Towards evening Ch‘u
re-appeared in high spirits, saying that he had succeeded
in his design, and had come to wish Ch‘ên a long farewell.
Holding out his open palms, he requested Ch‘ên
to write the word <i>Ch‘u</i> on each; and then, after refusing
to take a parting cup, he went away, telling Ch‘ên that
the examination-list would soon be out, and that they
would meet again before long. Ch‘ên brushed away his
tears and escorted him to the door, where a man, who
had been waiting for him, laid his hand on Ch‘u’s head
and pressed it downwards until Ch‘u was perfectly flat.
The man then put him in a sack and carried him off on
his back. A few days afterwards the list came out,
and, to his great joy, Ch‘ên found his name among the
successful candidates; whereupon he immediately started
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-126"><a id="Page_ii-126"></a></span>
off to visit his old tutor, Mr. Lü.<a id="Anchor-458" title="Go to Footnote 458" href="#Footnote-458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Now Mr. Lü’s wife
had had no children for ten years, being about fifty years
of age, when suddenly she gave birth to a son, who was
born with both fists doubled up so that no one could
open them. On his arrival Ch‘ên begged to see the
child, and declared that inside its hands would be found
written the word Ch‘u. Old Mr. Lü laughed at this;
but no sooner had the child set eyes on Ch‘ên than both
its fists opened spontaneously, and there was the word as
Ch‘ên had said. The story was soon told, and Ch‘ên
went home, after making a handsome present to the
family; and later on, when Mr. Lü went up for his
doctor’s degree<a id="Anchor-459" title="Go to Footnote 459" href="#Footnote-459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> and stayed at Ch‘ên’s house, his son
was thirteen years old, and had already matriculated as a
candidate for literary honours.</p>

THE CLOTH MERCHANT.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> cloth merchant went to Ch‘ing-chou, where
he happened to stroll into an old temple, all tumble-down
and in ruins. He was lamenting over this sad
state of things, when a priest who stood by observed
that a devout believer like himself could hardly do
better than put the place into repair, and thus obtain
favour in the eyes of Buddha. This the merchant consented
to do; whereupon the priest invited him to walk
into the private quarters of the temple, and treated him
with much courtesy; but he went on to propose that our
friend the merchant should also undertake the general
ornamentation of the place both inside and out.<a id="Anchor-460" title="Go to Footnote 460" href="#Footnote-460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> The
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-128"><a id="Page_ii-128"></a></span>
latter declared he could not afford the expense, and the
priest began to get very angry, and urged him so
strongly that at last the merchant, in terror, promised to
give all the money he had. After this he was preparing to
go away, but the priest detained him, saying, “You
haven’t given the money of your own free will, and consequently
you’ll be owing me a grudge: I can’t do better
than make an end of you at once.” Thereupon he
seized a knife, and refused to listen to all the cloth
merchant’s entreaties, until at length the latter asked to
be allowed to hang himself, to which the priest consented;
and, showing him into a dark room, told him to
make haste about it.</p>

<p>At this juncture, a Tartar-General<a id="Anchor-461" title="Go to Footnote 461" href="#Footnote-461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> happened to pass
by the temple; and from a distance, through a breach in
the old wall, he saw a damsel in a red dress pass into
the priest’s quarters. This roused his suspicions,<a id="Anchor-462" title="Go to Footnote 462" href="#Footnote-462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> and
dismounting from his horse, he entered the temple and
searched high and low, but without discovering anything.
The dark room above-mentioned was locked and double-barred,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-129"><a id="Page_ii-129"></a></span>
and the priest refused to open it, saying the place
was haunted. The General in a rage burst open the
door, and there beheld the cloth merchant hanging from
a beam. He cut him down at once, and in a short time
he was brought round and told the General the whole
story. They then searched for the damsel, but she was
nowhere to be found, having been nothing more than a
divine manifestation. The General cut off the priest’s
head and restored the cloth merchant’s property to him,
after which the latter put the temple in thorough repair
and kept it well supplied with lights and incense ever
afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. Chao, <abbr title="Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr>, told me this story with all its details.<a id="Anchor-463" title="Go to Footnote 463" href="#Footnote-463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

A STRANGE COMPANION.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Han Kung-fu</span>, of Yü-ch‘êng, told me that he was one
day travelling along a road with a man of his village,
named P‘êng, when all of a sudden the latter disappeared,
leaving his mule to jog along with an empty
saddle. At the same moment, Mr. Han heard his voice
calling for assistance, and apparently proceeding from
inside one of the panniers strapped across the mule’s
back; and on looking closely, there indeed he was in
one of the panniers, which, however, did not seem to be
at all displaced by his weight. On trying to get him out
the mouth of the pannier closed itself tightly; and it
was only when he cut it open with a knife that he saw
P‘êng curled up in it like a dog. He then helped him
out, and asked him how he managed to get in; but this
he was unable to say. It further appeared that his
family was under fox influence, many strange things of
this kind having happened before.</p>

SPIRITUALISTIC SÉANCES.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">It</span> is customary in Shantung, when any one is sick, for
the womenfolk to engage an old sorceress or medium,
who strums on a tambourine and performs certain
mysterious antics. This custom obtains even more in
the capital, where young ladies of the best families frequently
organize such <i>séances</i> among themselves. On a
table in the hall they spread out a profusion of wine and
meat, and burn huge candles which make the place as
light as day. Then the sorceress, shortening her skirts,
stands on one leg and performs the <i>shang-yang</i>,<a id="Anchor-464" title="Go to Footnote 464" href="#Footnote-464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> while
two of the others support her, one on each side. All
this time she is chattering unintelligible sentences,<a id="Anchor-465" title="Go to Footnote 465" href="#Footnote-465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> something
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-132"><a id="Page_ii-132"></a></span>
between a song and a prayer, the words being confused
but uttered in a sort of tune; while the hall resounds
with the thunder of drums, enough to stun a
person, with which her vaticinations are mixed up and
lost. By-and-by her head begins to droop, and her eyes
to look aslant; and but for her two supporters she would
inevitably fall to the ground. Suddenly she stretches
forth her neck and bounds several feet into the air, upon
which the other women regard her in terror, saying,
“The spirits have come to eat;” and immediately all
the candles are blown out and everything is in total
darkness. Thus they remain for about a quarter of an
hour, afraid to speak a word, which in any case would
not be heard through the din, until at length the
sorceress calls out the personal name of the head of the
family<a id="Anchor-466" title="Go to Footnote 466" href="#Footnote-466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> and some others; whereupon they immediately
relight the candles and hurry up to ask if the reply of
the spirits is favourable or otherwise. They then see
that every scrap of the food and every drop of the wine
has disappeared. Meanwhile, they watch the old
woman’s expression, whereby they can tell if the spirits
are well disposed; and each one asks her some question,
to which she as promptly replies. Should there be
any unbelievers among the party, the spirits are at once
aware of their presence; and the old sorceress, pointing
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-133"><a id="Page_ii-133"></a></span>
her finger at such a one, cries out, “Disrespectful
mocker! where are your trousers?” upon which the
mocker alluded to looks down, and lo! her trousers are
gone&mdash;gone to the top of a tree in the court-yard, where
they will subsequently be found.<a id="Anchor-467" title="Go to Footnote 467" href="#Footnote-467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<p>Manchu women and girls, especially, are firm believers
in spiritualism. On the slightest provocation they consult
their medium, who comes into the room gorgeously
dressed, and riding on an imitation horse or tiger.<a id="Anchor-468" title="Go to Footnote 468" href="#Footnote-468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> In
her hand she holds a long spear, with which she mounts
the couch<a id="Anchor-469" title="Go to Footnote 469" href="#Footnote-469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> and postures in an extraordinary manner,
the animal she rides snorting or roaring fiercely all the
time. Some call her Kuan Ti,<a id="Anchor-470" title="Go to Footnote 470" href="#Footnote-470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> others Chang Fei, and
others again Chou Kung, from her terribly martial
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-134"><a id="Page_ii-134"></a></span>
aspect, which strikes fear into all beholders. And should
any daring fellow try to peep in while the <i>séance</i> is going
on, out of the window darts the spear, transfixes his hat,
and draws it off his head into the room, while women
and girls, young and old, hop round one after the other
like geese, on one leg, without seeming to get the least
fatigued.</p>

THE MYSTERIOUS HEAD.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Several</span> traders who were lodging at an inn in
Peking, occupied a room which was divided from the adjoining
apartment by a partition of boards from which a
piece was missing, leaving an aperture about as big as a
basin. Suddenly a girl’s head appeared through the
opening, with very pretty features and nicely dressed
hair; and the next moment an arm, as white as polished
jade. The traders were much alarmed, and, thinking it
was the work of devils, tried to seize the head, which,
however, was quickly drawn in again out of their reach.
This happened a second time, and then, as they could
see no body belonging to the head, one of them took a
knife in his hand and crept up against the partition
underneath the hole. In a little while the head re-appeared,
when he made a chop at it and cut it off, the
blood spurting out all over the floor and wall. The
traders hurried off to tell the landlord, who immediately
reported the matter to the authorities, taking the head
with him, and the traders were forthwith arrested and
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-136"><a id="Page_ii-136"></a></span>
examined; but the magistrate could make nothing of the
case, and, as no one appeared for the prosecution, the
accused, after about six months’ incarceration, were
accordingly released, and orders were given for the girl’s
head to be buried.</p>

when he came upon a number of persons sitting on the
ground engaged in drinking. As soon as they saw Li
they begged him to join them, and vied with each other
in filling his cup. Meanwhile, he looked about him and
noticed that the various trays and dishes contained all
kinds of costly food; the wine only seemed to him a
little rough on the palate. In the middle of their fun
up came a stranger with a face about three feet long and
a very tall hat; whereupon the others were very much
alarmed, and cried out, “The hill spirit! the hill
spirit!” running away in all directions as fast as they
could go. Li hid himself in a hole in the ground; and
when by-and-by he peeped out to see what had happened,
the wine and food had disappeared, and there
was nothing there but a few dirty potsherds and some
pieces of broken tiles with efts and lizards crawling over
them.<a id="Anchor-471" title="Go to Footnote 471" href="#Footnote-471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">K‘u Ta-yu</span> was a native of the Yang district, and

that the game was lost, and immediately turned his
forces upon Tsu Shu-shun, whom he succeeded in capturing,
after Tsu had been wounded in the hand, and
whom he at once forwarded as a prisoner to headquarters.
That night he dreamed that the Judge of
Purgatory appeared to him, and, reproaching him with
his base ingratitude, bade the devil-lictors seize him and
scald his feet in a cauldron of boiling oil. K‘u then

SMELLING ESSAYS.</a><a id="Anchor-473" title="Go to Footnote 473" href="#Footnote-473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Now</span> as they wandered about the temple they came
upon an old blind priest sitting under the verandah,
engaged in selling medicines and prescribing for patients.
“Ah!” cried Sung, “there is an extraordinary man who
is well versed in the arts of composition;” and immediately
he sent back to get the essay they had just
been reading, in order to obtain the old priest’s opinion
as to its merits. At the same moment up came their
friend from Yü-hang, and all three went along together.
Wang began by addressing him as “Professor;” whereupon
the priest, who thought the stranger had come to
consult him as a doctor, inquired what might be the
disease from which he was suffering. Wang then explained
what his mission was; upon which the priest
smiled and said, “Who’s been telling you this nonsense?
How can a man with no eyes discuss with you the merits
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-140"><a id="Page_ii-140"></a></span>
of your compositions?” Wang replied by asking him to
let his ears do duty for his eyes; but the priest answered
that he would hardly have patience to sit out Wang’s
three sections, amounting perhaps to some two thousand
and more words. “However,” added he, “if you like
to burn it, I’ll try what I can do with my nose.” Wang
complied, and burnt the first section there and then; and
the old priest, snuffing up the smoke, declared that it
wasn’t such a bad effort, and finally gave it as his
opinion that Wang would probably succeed at the
examination. The young scholar from Yü-hang didn’t
believe that the old priest could really tell anything by
these means, and forthwith proceeded to burn an essay
by one of the old masters; but the priest no sooner
smelt the smoke than he cried out, “Beautiful indeed!
beautiful indeed! I do enjoy this. The light of genius
and truth is evident here.” The Yü-hang scholar was
greatly astonished at this, and began to burn an essay of
his own; whereupon the priest said, “I had had but a
taste of that one; why change so soon to another?”
“The first paragraph,” replied the young man, “was by
a friend; the rest is my own composition.” No sooner
had he uttered these words than the old priest began to
retch violently, and begged that he might have no more,
as he was sure it would make him sick. The Yü-hang
scholar was much abashed at this, and went away; but
in a few days the list came out and his name was among
the successful ones, while Wang’s was not. He at once
hurried off to tell the old priest, who, when he heard the
news, sighed and said, “I may be blind with my eyes
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-141"><a id="Page_ii-141"></a></span>
but I am not so with my nose, which I fear is the case
with the examiners. Besides,” added he, “I was talking
to you about composition: I said nothing about <em>destiny</em>.”<a id="Anchor-474" title="Go to Footnote 474" href="#Footnote-474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

HIS FATHER’S GHOST.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A man</span> named T‘ien Tzŭ-ch‘êng, of Chiang-ning, was
crossing the Tung-t‘ing lake, when the boat was capsized,
and he was drowned. His son, Liang-ssŭ, who,
towards the close of the Ming dynasty, took the highest
degree, was then a baby in arms; and his wife, hearing
the bad news, swallowed poison forthwith,<a id="Anchor-475" title="Go to Footnote 475" href="#Footnote-475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> and left the
child to the care of his grandmother. When Liang-ssŭ
grew up, he was appointed magistrate in Hu-pei, where
he remained about a year. He was then transferred to
Hu-nan, on military service; but, on reaching the Tung-t‘ing
lake, his feelings overpowered him, and he returned
to plead inability as an excuse for not taking
up his post. Accordingly, he was degraded to the rank
of Assistant-Magistrate, which he at first declined, but
was finally compelled to accept; and thenceforward
gave himself up to roaming about on the lakes and
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-143"><a id="Page_ii-143"></a></span>
streams of the surrounding country, without paying
much attention to his official duties.</p>

<p>One night he had anchored his boat alongside the
bank of a river, when suddenly the cadence of a
sweetly-played flageolet broke upon his ear; so he
strolled along by the light of the moon in the direction
of the music, until, after a few minutes’ walking, he
reached a cottage standing by itself, with a few citron-trees
round it, and brilliantly-lighted inside. Approaching
a window, he peeped in, and saw three persons
sitting at a table, engaged in drinking. In the place
of honour was a graduate of about thirty years of age;
an old man played the host, and at the side sat a
much younger man playing on the flageolet. When
he had finished, the old man clapped his hands in
admiration; but the graduate turned away with a sigh,
as if he had not heard a note. “Come now, Mr. Lu,”
cried the old man, addressing the latter, “kindly
favour us with one of your songs, which, I know, must
be worth hearing.” The graduate then began to sing as
<span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse_i-0-5">“Over the river the wind blows cold on lonely me:</div>
<div class="verse_i1-5"><span class="legacy-indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Each flow’ret trampled under foot, all verdure gone.</div>
<div class="verse_i0">At home a thousand <i>li</i> away, I cannot be;</div>
<div class="verse_i1-5"><span class="legacy-indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So towards the Bridge my spirit nightly wanders on.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The above was given in such melancholy tones that
the old man smiled and said, “Mr. Lu, these must be
experiences of your own,” and, immediately filling a
goblet, added, “I can do nothing like that; but if you
will let me, I will give you a song to help us on with
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-144"><a id="Page_ii-144"></a></span>
our wine.” He then sung a verse from “Li T‘ai-poh,”<a id="Anchor-476" title="Go to Footnote 476" href="#Footnote-476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
and put them all in a lively humour again; after
which the young man said he would just go outside
and see how high the moon was, which he did, and
observing Liang-ssŭ outside, clapped his hands, and
cried out to his companions, “There is a man at the
window, who has seen all we have been doing.” He
then led Liang-ssŭ in; whereupon the other two rose,
and begged him to be seated, and to join them in
their wine. The wine, however, was cold,<a id="Anchor-477" title="Go to Footnote 477" href="#Footnote-477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> and he
therefore declined; but the young man at once perceived
his reason, and proceeded to warm some for
him. Liang-ssŭ now ordered his servant to go and buy
some more, but this his host would not permit him to
do. They next inquired Liang-ssŭ’s name, and whence
he came, and then the old man said, “Why, then, you
are the father and mother<a id="Anchor-478" title="Go to Footnote 478" href="#Footnote-478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> of the district in which I
live. My name is River: I am an old resident here.
This young man is a Mr. Tu, of Kiang-si; and this
gentleman,” added he, pointing to the graduate, “is
Mr. Rushten,<a id="Anchor-479" title="Go to Footnote 479" href="#Footnote-479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> a fellow-provincial of yours.” Mr.
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-145"><a id="Page_ii-145"></a></span>
Rushten looked at Liang-ssŭ in rather a contemptuous
way, and without taking much notice of him; whereupon
Liang-ssŭ asked him whereabouts he lived in
Chiang-ning, observing that it was strange he himself
should never have heard of such an accomplished
gentleman. “Alas!” replied Rushten, “it is many a
long day since I left my home, and I know nothing
even of my own family. Alas, indeed!” These words
were uttered in so mournful a tone of voice that the
old man broke in with, “Come, come, now! talking
like this, instead of drinking when we’re all so jolly
together; this will never do.” He then drained a
bumper himself, and said, “I propose a game of
forfeits. We’ll throw with three dice; and whoever
throws so that the spots on one die<a id="Anchor-480" title="Go to Footnote 480" href="#Footnote-480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> equal those on
the other two shall give us a verse with a corresponding
classical allusion in it.” He then threw himself,
and turned up an ace, a two, and a three; whereupon
he <a id="tn_17">sang</a> the following <span class="nowrap">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="pagenum" title="ii-146"><a id="Page_ii-146"></a></span>
Then the young musician threw, and turned up two
twos and a four; whereupon he exclaimed, “Don’t

When the <i xml:lang="fr">partie</i> was over Liang-ssŭ rose to go, but
Mr. Rushten said, “Dear me! why are you in such a
hurry; we haven’t had a moment to speak of the old
place. Please stay: I was just going to ask you a few
questions.” So Liang-ssŭ sat down again, and Mr.
Rushten proceeded. “I had an old friend,” said he,
“who was drowned in the Tung-t‘ing lake. He bore
the same name as yourself; was he a relative?” “He
was my father,” replied Liang-ssŭ; “how did you know
him?” “We were friends as boys together; and when
he was drowned, I recovered and buried his body by
the river-side.”<a id="Anchor-485" title="Go to Footnote 485" href="#Footnote-485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> Liang-ssŭ here burst into tears, and
thanked Mr. Rushten very warmly, begging him to point
out his father’s grave. “Come again to-morrow,” said
Mr. Rushten, “and I will shew it to you. You could
easily find it yourself. It is close by here, and has ten
stalks of water-rush growing on it.” Liang-ssŭ now took
his leave, and went back to his boat, but he could not
sleep for thinking of what Mr. Rushten had told him;
and at length, without waiting for the dawn, he set out
to look for the grave. To his great astonishment, the
house where he had spent the previous evening had disappeared;
but hunting about in the direction indicated
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-148"><a id="Page_ii-148"></a></span>
by Mr. Rushten, he found a grave with ten water-rushes
growing on it, precisely as Mr. Rushten had described.
It then flashed across him that Mr. Rushten’s name had
a special meaning, and that he had been holding converse
with none other than the disembodied spirit of his
own father. And, on inquiring of the people of the
place, he learnt that twenty years before a benevolent
old gentleman, named Kao, had been in the habit of
collecting the bodies of persons found drowned, and
burying them in that spot. Liang then opened the
grave, and carried off his father’s remains to his own
home, where his grandmother, to whom he described
Mr. Rushten’s appearance, confirmed the suspicion he
himself had formed. It also turned out that the young
musician was a cousin of his, who had been drowned
when nineteen years of age; and then he recollected
that the boy’s father had subsequently gone to Kiang-si,
and that his mother had died there, and had been
buried at the Bamboo Bridge, to which Mr. Rushten
had alluded in his song. But he did not know who the
old man was.<a id="Anchor-486" title="Go to Footnote 486" href="#Footnote-486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<br/>
THE BOAT-GIRL BRIDE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Wang Kuli-ngan</span> was a young man of good family.
It happened once when he was travelling southwards,
and had moored his boat to the bank, that he saw in
another boat close by a young boat-girl embroidering
shoes. He was much struck by her beauty, and continued
gazing at her for some time, though she took not
the slightest notice of him. By-and-by he began
<span class="nowrap">singing&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse_i-0-5">“The Lo-yang lady lives over the way:</div>
<div class="verse_i0">[Fifteen years is her age I should say].”<a id="Anchor-487" title="Go to Footnote 487" href="#Footnote-487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">to attract her attention, and then she seemed to perceive
that he was addressing himself to her; but, after
just raising her head and glancing at him, she resumed
her embroidery as before. Wang then threw a piece
of silver towards her, which fell on her skirt; however
she merely picked it up, and flung it on to the
bank, as if she had not seen what it was, so Wang
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-150"><a id="Page_ii-150"></a></span>
put it back in his pocket again. He followed up by
throwing her a gold bracelet, to which she paid no
attention whatever, never taking her eyes off her work.
A few minutes after her father appeared, much to the
dismay of Wang, who was afraid he would see the
bracelet; but the young girl quietly placed her feet
over it, and concealed it from his sight. The boatman
let go the painter, and away they went down stream,
leaving Wang sitting there, not knowing what to do
next. And, having recently lost his wife, he regretted
that he had not seized this opportunity to make another
match; the more so, as when he came to ask the other
boat-people of the place, no one knew anything about
them. So Wang got into his own boat, and started off in
pursuit; but evening came on, and, as he could see
nothing of them, he was obliged to turn back and
proceed in the direction where business was taking
him. When he had finished that, he returned, making
inquiries all the way along, but without hearing anything
about the object of his search. On arriving at home,
he was unable either to eat or to sleep, so much did
this affair occupy his mind; and about a year afterwards
he went south again, bought a boat, and lived
in it as his home, watching carefully every single vessel
that passed either up or down, until at last there was
hardly one he didn’t know by sight. But all this time
the boat he was looking for never reappeared.</p>

<p>Some six months passed away thus, and then, having
exhausted all his funds, he was obliged to go home,
where he remained in a state of general inaptitude for
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-151"><a id="Page_ii-151"></a></span>
anything. One night he dreamed that he entered a
village on the river-bank, and that, after passing several
houses, he saw one with a door towards the south,
and a palisade of bamboos inside. Thinking it was a
garden, he walked in and beheld a beautiful magnolia,
covered with blossoms, which reminded him of the
<span class="nowrap">line&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse_i0">“And Judas-tree in flower before her door.”<a id="Anchor-488" title="Go to Footnote 488" href="#Footnote-488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">A few steps farther on was a neat bamboo hedge, on
the other side of which, towards the north, he found
a small house, with three columns, the door of which
was locked; and another, towards the south, with its
window shaded by the broad leaves of a plaintain-tree.
The door was barred by a clothes-horse,<a id="Anchor-489" title="Go to Footnote 489" href="#Footnote-489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> on which
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-152"><a id="Page_ii-152"></a></span>
was hanging an embroidered petticoat; and, on seeing
this, Wang stepped back, knowing that he had got to
the ladies’ quarters; but his presence had already been
noticed inside, and, in another moment, out came his
heroine of the boat. Overjoyed at seeing her, he was
on the point of grasping her hand, when suddenly the
girl’s father arrived, and, in his consternation, Wang
waked up, and found that it was all a dream. Every
incident of it, however, remained clear and distinct in
his mind, and he took care to say nothing about it to
anybody, for fear of destroying its reality.</p>

<p>Another year passed away, and he went again to
Chinkiang, where lived an official, named Hsü, who
was an old friend of the family, and who invited Wang
to come and take a cup of wine with him. On his
way thither, Wang lost his way, but at length reached
a village which seemed familiar to him, and which he
soon found, by the door with the magnolia inside, to be
identical, in every particular, with the village of his
dream. He went in through the doorway, and there
was everything as he had seen it in his dream, even to
the boat-girl herself. She jumped up on his arrival,
and, shutting the door in his face, asked what his
business was there. Wang inquired if she had forgotten
about the bracelet, and went on to tell her how long
he had been searching for her, and how, at last, she
had been revealed to him in a dream. The girl then
begged to know his name and family; and when she
heard who he was, she asked what a gentleman like
himself could want with a poor boat-girl like her, as
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-153"><a id="Page_ii-153"></a></span>
he must have a wife of his own. “But for you,”
replied Wang, “I should, indeed, have been married
long ago.” Upon which the girl told him if that was
really the case, he had better apply to her parents,
“although,” added she, “they have already refused a
great many offers for me. The bracelet you gave me
is here, but my father and mother are just now away
from home; they will be back shortly. You go away
now and engage a match-maker, when I dare say it
will be all right if the proper formalities are observed.”
Wang then retired, the girl calling after him to remember
that her name was Mêng Yün, and her father’s
Mêng Chiang-li. He proceeded at once on his way to
Mr. Hsü’s, and after that sought out his intended
father-in-law, telling him who he was, and offering him
at the same time one hundred ounces of silver, as
betrothal-money for his daughter. “She is already
promised,” replied the old man; upon which Wang
declared he had been making careful inquiries, and had
heard, on all sides, that the young lady was not engaged,
winding up by begging to know what objection
there was to his suit. “I have just promised her,”
answered her father, “and I cannot possibly break my
word;” so Wang went away, deeply mortified, not
knowing whether to believe it or not. That night he
tossed about a good deal; and next morning, braving
the ridicule with which he imagined his friend would
view his wished-for alliance with a boat-girl, he went
off to Mr. Hsü, and told him all about it. “Why
didn’t you consult me before?” cried Mr. Hsü; “her
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-154"><a id="Page_ii-154"></a></span>
father is a connection of mine.” Wang then went on
to give fuller particulars, which his friend interrupted
by saying, “Chang-li is indeed poor, but he has never
been a boatman. Are you sure you are not making
a mistake?” He then sent off his elder son to make
inquiries; and to him the girl’s father said, “Poor I
am, but I don’t <em>sell</em> my daughter.<a id="Anchor-490" title="Go to Footnote 490" href="#Footnote-490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> Your friend imagined
that I should be tempted by the sight of his money
to forego the usual ceremonies, and so I won’t have
anything to do with him. But if your father desires
this match, and everything is in proper order, I will
just go in and consult with my daughter, and see if she
is willing.” He then retired for a few minutes, and
when he came back he raised his hands in congratulation,
saying, “Everything is as you wish;” whereupon
a day was fixed, and the young man went home to
report to his father. Wang now sent off betrothal
presents, with the usual formalities, and took up his
abode with his friend, Mr. Hsü, until the marriage
was solemnized, three days after which he bade adieu
to his father-in-law, and started on his way northwards.
In the evening, as they were sitting on the boat together,
Wang said to his wife, “When I first met you
near this spot, I fancied you were not of the ordinary
boating-class. Where were you then going?” “I was
going to visit my uncle,” she replied. “We are not a
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-155"><a id="Page_ii-155"></a></span>
wealthy family, you know, but we don’t want anything
through an improper channel; and I couldn’t help
smiling at the great eyes you were making at me, all
the time trying to tempt me with money. But when I
heard you speak, I knew at once you were a man of
refinement, though I guessed you were a bit of a rake;
and so I hid your bracelet, and saved you from the
wrath of my father.” “And yet,” replied Wang, “you
have fallen into my snare after all;” adding, after a little
pressure, “for I can’t conceal from you much longer
the fact that I have already a wife, belonging to a high
official family.” This she did not believe, until he began
to affirm it seriously; and then she jumped up and ran
out of the cabin. Wang followed at once, but, before
he could reach her, she was already in the river; whereupon
he shouted out to boats to come to their assistance,
causing quite a commotion all round about; but nothing
was to be seen in the river, save only the reflection of
the stars shining brightly on the water. All night long
Wang went sorrowfully up and down, and offered a high
reward for the body, which, however, was not forthcoming.
So he went home in despair, and then, fearing
lest his father-in-law should come to visit his daughter,
he started on a visit to a connection of his, who had an
appointment in Honan. In the course of a year or two,
when on his homeward journey, he chanced to be detained
by bad weather at a roadside inn of rather cleaner
appearance than usual. Within he saw an old woman
playing with a child, which, as soon as he entered, held
out its arms to him to be taken. Wang took the child
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-156"><a id="Page_ii-156"></a></span>
on his knee, and there it remained, refusing to go back
to its nurse; and, when the rain had stopped, and Wang
was getting ready to go, the child cried out, “Pa-pa
gone!” The nurse told it to hold its tongue, and, at
the same moment, out from behind the screen came
Wang’s long-lost wife. “You bad fellow,” said she,
“what am I to do with this?” pointing to the child;
and then Wang knew that the boy was his own son. He
was much affected, and swore by the sun<a id="Anchor-491" title="Go to Footnote 491" href="#Footnote-491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> that the
words he had uttered had been uttered in jest, and
by-and-by his wife’s anger was soothed. She then explained
how she had been picked up by a passing boat,
the occupant of which was the owner of the house they
were in, a man of sixty years of age, who had no
children of his own, and who kindly adopted her.<a id="Anchor-492" title="Go to Footnote 492" href="#Footnote-492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> She
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-157"><a id="Page_ii-157"></a></span>
also told him how she had had several offers of marriage,
all of which she had refused, and how her child was
born, and that she had called him Chi-shêng, and that he
was then a year old. Wang now unpacked his baggage
again, and went in to see the old gentleman and his
wife, whom he treated as if they had actually been his
wife’s parents. A few days afterwards they set off
together towards Wang’s home, where they found his
wife’s real father awaiting them. He had been there
more than two months, and had been considerably disconcerted
by the mysterious remarks of Wang’s servants;
but the arrival of his daughter and her husband made
things all smooth again, and when they told him what
had happened, he understood the demeanour of the
servants which had seemed so strange to him at
first.</p>

<br/>
THE TWO BRIDES.</a><a id="Anchor-493" title="Go to Footnote 493" href="#Footnote-493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Now</span> Chi-shêng, or Wang Sun, was one of the
cleverest young fellows in the district; and his father
and mother, who had foreseen his ability from the time
when, as a baby in long clothes, he distinguished them from
other people, loved him very dearly. He grew up into a
handsome lad; at eight or nine he could compose elegantly,
and by fourteen he had already entered his name
as a candidate for the first degree, after which his marriage
became a question for consideration. Now his
father’s younger sister, Erh-niang, had married a gentleman
named Chêng Tzŭ-ch‘iao, and they had a daughter
called Kuei-hsiu, who was extremely pretty, and with
whom Chi-shêng fell deeply in love, being soon unable
either to eat or to sleep. His parents became extremely
uneasy about him, and inquired what it was that ailed
him; and when he told them, they at once sent off a
match-maker to Mr. Chêng. The latter, however, was
rather a stickler for the proprieties, and replied that the
near relationship precluded him from accepting the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-159"><a id="Page_ii-159"></a></span>
offer.<a id="Anchor-494" title="Go to Footnote 494" href="#Footnote-494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Thereupon Chi-shêng became dangerously ill,
and his mother, not knowing what to do, secretly tried to
persuade Erh-niang to let her daughter come over to
their house; but Mr. Chêng heard of it, and was so
angry that Chi-shêng’s father and mother gave up all hope
of arranging the match.</p>

<p>At that time there was a gentleman named Chang
living near by, who had five daughters, all very pretty,
but the youngest, called Wu-k‘o, was singularly beautiful,
far surpassing her four sisters. She was not betrothed to
any one, when one day, as she was on her way to worship
at the family tombs, she chanced to see Chi-shêng, and
at her return home spoke about him to her mother. Her
mother guessed what her meaning was, and arranged
with a match-maker, named Mrs. Yü, to call upon Chi-shêng’s
parents. This she did precisely at the time when
Chi-shêng was so ill, and forthwith told his mother that
her son’s complaint was one she, Mrs. Yü, was quite
competent to cure; going on to tell her about Miss
Wu-k‘o and the proposed marriage, at which the good
lady was delighted, and sent her in to talk about it to
Chi-shêng himself. “Alas!” cried he, when he had
heard Mrs. Yü’s story, “you are bringing me the
wrong medicine for my complaint.” “All depends
upon the efficacy of the medicine,” replied Mrs. Yü;
“if the medicine is good, it matters not what is the
name of the doctor who administers the draught; while
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-160"><a id="Page_ii-160"></a></span>
to set your heart on a particular person, and to lie there
and die because that person doesn’t come, is surely
foolish in the extreme.” “Ah,” rejoined Chi-shêng,
“there’s no medicine under heaven that will do me any
good.” Mrs. Yü told him his experience was limited,
and proceeded to expatiate by speaking and gesticulating
on the beauty and liveliness of Wu-k‘o. But all Chi-shêng
said was that she was not what he wanted, and,
turning round his face to the wall, would listen to no
more about her. So Mrs. Yü was obliged to go away,
and Chi-shêng became worse and worse every day, until
suddenly one of the maids came in and informed him
that the young lady herself was at the door. Immediately
he jumped up and ran out, and lo! there before
him stood a beautiful girl, whom, however he soon discovered
not to be Kuei-hsiu. She wore a light yellow
robe with a fine silk jacket and an embroidered petticoat,
from beneath which her two little feet peeped out; and
altogether she more resembled a fairy than anything else.
Chi-shêng inquired her name; to which she replied that
it was Wu-k‘o, adding that she couldn’t understand his
devoted attachment to Kuei-hsiu, as if there was nobody
else in the world. Chi-shêng apologized, saying that he
had never before seen any one so beautiful as Kuei-hsiu,
but that he was now aware of his mistake. He then
swore everlasting fidelity to her, and was just grasping
her hand, when he awoke and found his mother rubbing
him. It was a dream, but so accurately defined in all
its details that he began to think if Wu-k‘o was really
such as he had seen her, there would be no further need
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-161"><a id="Page_ii-161"></a></span>
to try for his impracticable cousin. So he communicated
his dream to his mother; and she, only too
delighted to notice this change of feeling, offered to go
to Wu-k‘o’s house herself; but Chi-shêng would not hear
of this, and arranged with an old woman who knew the
family to find some pretext for going there, and to report
to him what Wu-k‘o was like. When she arrived Wu-k‘o
was ill in bed, and lay with her head propped up by
pillows, looking very pretty indeed. The old woman
approached the couch and asked what was the matter;
to which Wu-k‘o made no reply, her fingers fidgetting all
the time with her waistband. “She’s been behaving
badly to her father and mother,” cried the latter, who
was in the room; “there’s many a one has offered to
marry her, but she says she’ll have none but Chi-shêng:
and then when I scold her a bit, she takes on and won’t
touch her food for days.” “Madam,” said the old
woman, “if you could get that young man for your
daughter they would make a truly pretty pair; and as for
him, if he could only see Miss Wu-k‘o, I’m afraid it
would be too much for him. What do you think of my
going there and getting them to make proposals?” “No,
thank you,” replied Wu-k‘o; “I would rather not risk
his refusal;” upon which the old woman declared she
would succeed, and hurried off to tell Chi-shêng, who
was delighted to find from her report that Wu-k‘o was
exactly as he had seen her in his dream, though he
didn’t trust implicitly in all the old woman said. By-and-by,
when he began to get a little better, he consulted
with the old woman as to how he could see Wu-k‘o with
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-162"><a id="Page_ii-162"></a></span>
his own eyes; and, after some little difficulty, it was
arranged that Chi-shêng should hide himself in a room
from which he would be able to see her as she crossed
the yard supported by a maid, which she did every day
at a certain hour. This Chi-shêng proceeded to do, and
in a little while out she came, accompanied by the old
woman as well, who instantly drew her attention either
to the clouds or the trees, in order that she should walk
more leisurely. Thus Chi-shêng had a good look at her,
and saw that she was truly the young lady of his dream.
He could hardly contain himself for joy; and when the
old woman arrived and asked if she would do instead of
Kuei-hsiu, he thanked her very warmly and returned to
his own home. There he told his father and mother,
who sent off a match-maker to arrange the preliminaries;
but the latter came back and told them that Wu-k‘o was
already betrothed. This was a terrible blow for Chi-shêng,
who was soon as ill as ever, and offered no reply
to his father and mother when they charged him with
having made a mistake. For several months he ate
nothing but a bowl of rice-gruel a-day, and he became as
emaciated as a fowl, when all of a sudden the old woman
walked in and asked him what was the matter. “Foolish
boy,” said she, when he had told her all; “before you
wouldn’t have her, and do you imagine she is bound to
have you now? But I’ll see if I can’t help you; for
were she the Emperor’s own daughter, I should still find
some way of getting her.” Chi-shêng asked what he
should do, and she then told him to send a servant with
a letter next day to Wu-k‘o’s house, to which his father
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-163"><a id="Page_ii-163"></a></span>
at first objected for fear of another repulse; but the old
woman assured him that Wu-k‘o’s parents had since repented,
besides which no written contract had as yet
been made; “and you know the proverb,” added she,
“that those who are first at the fire will get their dinner
first.” So Chi-shêng’s father agreed, and two servants
were accordingly sent, their mission proving a complete
success. Chi-shêng now rapidly recovered his health,
and thought no more of Kuei-hsiu, who, when she heard
of the intended match, became in her turn very seriously
ill, to the great anger of her father, who said she might
die for all he cared, but to the great sorrow of her
mother, who was extremely fond of her daughter. The
latter even went so far as to propose to Mr. Chang that
Kuei-hsiu should go as second wife, at which he was so
enraged that he declared he would wash his hands of the
girl altogether. The mother then found out when Chi-shêng’s
wedding was to take place; and, borrowing a
chair and attendants from her brother under pretence of
going to visit him, put Kuei-hsiu inside and sent her off
to her uncle’s house. As she arrived at the door, the
servants spread a carpet for her to walk on, and the
band struck up the wedding march. Chi-shêng went out
to see what it was all about, and there met a young lady
in a bridal veil, from whom he would have escaped had
not her servants surrounded them, and, before he knew
what he was doing, he was making her the usual salutation
of a bridegroom. They then went in together, and,
to his further astonishment, he found that the young
lady was Kuei-hsiu; and, being now unable to go and
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-164"><a id="Page_ii-164"></a></span>
meet Wu-k‘o, a message was sent to her father, telling
him what had occurred. He, too, got into a great rage,
and vowed he would break off the match; but Wu-k‘o
herself said she would go all the same, her rival having
only got the start of her in point of time. And go she
did; and the two wives, instead of quarrelling, as was
expected, lived very happily together like sisters, and
wore each other’s clothes and shoes without distinction,
Kuei-hsiu taking the place of an elder sister as being
somewhat older than Wu-k‘o.<a id="Anchor-495" title="Go to Footnote 495" href="#Footnote-495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> One day, after these
events, Chi-shêng asked Wu-k‘o why she had refused
his offer; to which she replied that it was merely to pay
him out for having previously refused her father’s proposal.
“Before you had seen me, your head was full of
Kuei-hsiu; but after you had seen me, your thoughts
were somewhat divided; and I wanted to know how I
compared with her, and whether you would fall ill on
my account as you had on hers, that we mightn’t quarrel
about our looks.” “It was a cruel revenge,” said Chi-shêng;
“but how should I ever have got a sight of you
had it not been for the old woman?” “What had she
to do with it?” replied Wu-k‘o; “I knew you were
behind the door all the time. When I was ill I dreamt
that I went to your house and saw you, but I looked
upon it only as a dream until I heard that you had
dreamt that I had actually been there, and then I knew
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-165"><a id="Page_ii-165"></a></span>
that my spirit must have been with you.” Chi-shêng
now related to her the particulars of his vision, which
coincided exactly with her own; and thus, strangely
enough, had the matrimonial alliances of both father and
son been brought about by dreams.</p>

<h2><a id="chapter-96"><abbr title="Ninety-Six">XCVI.</abbr>
<br/>
A SUPERNATURAL WIFE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> Mr. Chao, of Ch‘ang-shan, lodged in a
family of the name of T‘ai. He was very badly off,
and, falling sick, was brought almost to death’s door.
One day they moved him into the verandah, that it
might be cooler for him; and, when he awoke from a
nap, lo! a beautiful girl was standing by his side. “I
am come to be your wife,” said the girl, in answer to his
question as to who she was; to which he replied that a
poor fellow like himself did not look for such luck as
that; adding that, being then on his death-bed, he would
not have much occasion for the services of a wife. The
girl said she could cure him; but he told her he very
much doubted that; “And even,” continued he, “should
you have any good prescription, I have not the means of
getting it made up.” “I don’t want medicine to cure
you with,” rejoined the girl, proceeding at once to rub
his back and sides with her hand, which seemed to him
like a ball of fire. He soon began to feel much better,
and asked the young lady what her name was, in order,
as he said, that he might remember her in his prayers.
“I am a spirit,” replied she; “and you, when alive
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-167"><a id="Page_ii-167"></a></span>
under the Han dynasty as Ch‘u Sui-liang, were a benefactor
of my family. Your kindness being engraven on my
heart, I have at length succeeded in my search for you,
and am able in some measure to requite you.” Chao was
dreadfully ashamed of his poverty-stricken state, and
afraid that his dirty room would spoil the young lady’s
dress; but she made him show her in, and accordingly
he took her into his apartment, where there were neither
chairs to sit upon, nor signs of anything to eat, saying, “You
might, indeed, be able to put up with all this; but you
see my larder is empty, and I have absolutely no means
of supporting a wife.” “Don’t be alarmed about that,”
cried she; and in another moment he saw a couch
covered with costly robes, the walls papered with a
silver-flecked paper, and chairs and tables appear, the
latter laden with all kinds of wine and exquisite viands.
They then began to enjoy themselves, and lived together
as husband and wife, many people coming to witness
these strange things, and being all cordially received by
the young lady, who in her turn always accompanied
Mr. Chao when he went out to dinner anywhere.<a id="Anchor-496" title="Go to Footnote 496" href="#Footnote-496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> One
day there was an unprincipled young graduate among
the company, which she seemed immediately to become
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-168"><a id="Page_ii-168"></a></span>
aware of; and, after calling him several bad names, she
struck him on the side of the head, causing his head to
fly out of the window while his body remained inside;
and there he was, stuck fast, unable to move either way,
until the others interceded for him and he was released.
After some time visitors became too numerous, and if
she refused to see them they turned their anger against
her husband. At length, as they were sitting together
drinking with some friends at the Tuan-yang festival,<a id="Anchor-497" title="Go to Footnote 497" href="#Footnote-497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> a
white rabbit ran in, whereupon the girl jumped up and
said, “The doctor<a id="Anchor-498" title="Go to Footnote 498" href="#Footnote-498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> has come for me;” then, turning to
the rabbit, she added, “You go on: I’ll follow you.” So
the rabbit went away, and then she ordered them to get
a ladder and place it against a high tree in the back
yard, the top of the ladder overtopping the tree. The
young lady went up first and Chao close behind her;
after which she called out to anybody who wished to join
them to make haste up. None ventured to do so with
the exception of a serving-boy belonging to the house,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-169"><a id="Page_ii-169"></a></span>
who followed after Chao; and thus they went up, up,
up, up, until they disappeared in the clouds and were
seen no more. However, when the bystanders came to
look at the ladder, they found it was only an old door-frame
with the panels knocked out; and when they went
into Mr. Chao’s room, it was the same old, dirty, unfurnished
room as before. So they determined to find
out all about it from the serving-boy when he came
back; but this he never did.</p>

<br/>
BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Pao-ting Fu there lived a young man, who having
purchased the lowest<a id="Anchor-499" title="Go to Footnote 499" href="#Footnote-499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> degree was about to proceed to
Peking, in the hope of obtaining, by the aid of a little
bribery, an appointment as District Magistrate. His
boxes were all ready packed, when he was taken
suddenly ill and was confined to his bed for more
than a month. One day the servant entered and announced
a visitor; whereupon our sick man jumped up
and ran to the door as if there was nothing the matter
with him. The visitor was elegantly dressed like a man
of some position in society; and, after bowing thrice, he
walked into the house, explaining that he was Kung-sun
Hsia,<a id="Anchor-500" title="Go to Footnote 500" href="#Footnote-500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> tutor to the Eleventh Prince, and that he had
heard our Mr. So-and-so wished to arrange for the
purchase of a magistracy. “If that is really so,” added
he, “would you not do better to buy a prefecture?”
So-and-so thanked him warmly, but said his funds would
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-171"><a id="Page_ii-171"></a></span>
not be sufficient; upon which Mr. Kung-sun declared he
should be delighted to assist him with half the purchase-money,
which he could repay after taking up the post.<a id="Anchor-501" title="Go to Footnote 501" href="#Footnote-501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>
He went on to say that being on intimate terms with the
various provincial Governors the thing could be easily
managed for about five thousand taels; and also that at
that very moment Chên-ting Fu being vacant, it would
be as well to make an early effort to get the appointment.
So-and-so pointed out that this place was in his native
province;<a id="Anchor-502" title="Go to Footnote 502" href="#Footnote-502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> but Kung-sun only laughed at his objection,
and reminded him that money<a id="Anchor-503" title="Go to Footnote 503" href="#Footnote-503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> could obliterate all distinctions
of that kind. This did not seem quite satisfactory;
however, Kung-sun told him not to be alarmed,
as the post of which he was speaking was below in the
infernal regions. “The fact is,” said he, “that your
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-172"><a id="Page_ii-172"></a></span>
term of life has expired, and that your name is already
on the death list; by these means you will take your
place in the world below as a man of official position.
Farewell! in three days we shall meet again.” He then
went to the door and mounted his horse and rode away.
So-and-so now opened his eyes and spoke a few parting
words to his wife and children, bidding them take money
from his strong-room<a id="Anchor-504" title="Go to Footnote 504" href="#Footnote-504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> and go buy large quantities of
paper ingots,<a id="Anchor-505" title="Go to Footnote 505" href="#Footnote-505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> which they immediately did, quite exhausting
all the shops. This was piled in the court-yard
with paper images of men, devils, horses, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, and
burning went on day and night until the ashes formed
quite a hill. In three days Kung-sun returned, bringing
with him the money; upon which So-and-so hurried off
to the Board of Civil Office,<a id="Anchor-506" title="Go to Footnote 506" href="#Footnote-506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> where he had an interview
with the high officials, who, after asking his name, warned
him to be a pure and upright officer, and then calling
him up to the table handed him his letter of appointment.
So-and-so bowed and took his leave; but recollecting
at once that his purchased degree would not
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-173"><a id="Page_ii-173"></a></span>
carry much weight with it in the eyes of his subordinates,<a id="Anchor-507" title="Go to Footnote 507" href="#Footnote-507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>
he sent off to buy elaborate chairs and a
number of horses for his retinue, at the same time
despatching several devil lictors to fetch his favourite
wife in a beautifully adorned sedan-chair. All arrangements
were just completed when some of the Chên-ting
staff came to meet the new Prefect,<a id="Anchor-508" title="Go to Footnote 508" href="#Footnote-508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> others awaiting
him all along the line of road, about half a mile in
length. He was immensely gratified at this reception,
when all of a sudden the gongs before him ceased to
sound and the banners were lowered to the ground. He
had hardly time to ask what was the matter before he
saw those of his servants who were on horseback jump
hastily to the ground and dwindle down to about a foot
in height, while their horses shrunk to the size of foxes
or racoons. One of the attendants near his chariot
cried out in alarm, “Here’s Kuan Ti!”<a id="Anchor-509" title="Go to Footnote 509" href="#Footnote-509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> and then he,
too, jumped out in a fright, and saw in the distance Kuan
Ti himself slowly approaching them, followed by four or
five retainers on horseback. His great beard covered
the lower half of his face, quite unlike ordinary mortals;
his aspect was terrible to behold, and his eyes reached
nearly to his ears. “Who is this?” roared he to his
servants; and they immediately informed him that it
was the new Prefect of Chên-ting. “What!” cried he;
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-174"><a id="Page_ii-174"></a></span>
“a petty fellow like that to have a retinue like this?”<a id="Anchor-510" title="Go to Footnote 510" href="#Footnote-510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>
Whereupon So-and-so’s flesh began to creep with fear,
and in a few moments he found that he too had shrunk
to the size of a little boy of six or seven. Kuan Ti
bade his attendants bring the new Prefect with them,
and went into a building at the roadside, where he took
up his seat facing the south<a id="Anchor-511" title="Go to Footnote 511" href="#Footnote-511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> and calling for writing
materials told So-and-so to write down his name and
address. When this was handed to him he flew into a
towering passion, and said, “The scribbly scrawl of a
placeman, indeed!<a id="Anchor-512" title="Go to Footnote 512" href="#Footnote-512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> Can such a one be entrusted with
the welfare of the people? Look me up the record of
his good works.” A man then advanced, and whispered
something in a low tone; upon which Kuan Ti exclaimed
in a loud voice, “The crime of the briber is comparatively
trifling; the heavy guilt lies with those who sell
official posts for money.” So-and-so was now seized by
angels in golden armour, and two of them tore off his
cap and robes, and administered to him fifty blows with
the bamboo until hardly any flesh remained on his
bones. He was then thrust outside the door, and lo!
his carriages and horses had disappeared, and he himself
was lying, unable to walk for pain, at no great distance
from his own house. However, his body seemed as light
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-175"><a id="Page_ii-175"></a></span>
as a leaf, and in a day and a night he managed to crawl
home. When he arrived, he awoke as it were from a
dream, and found himself groaning upon the bed; and
to the inquiries of his family he only replied that he felt
dreadfully sore. Now he really had been dead for seven
days; and when he came round thus, he immediately
asked for A-lien, which was the name of his favourite
wife. But the very day before, while chatting with the
other members of the family, A-lien had suddenly cried
out that her husband was made Prefect of Chên-ting,
and that his lictors had come to escort her thither.
Accordingly she retired to dress herself in her best
clothes, and, when ready to start, she fell back and expired.
Hearing this sad story, So-and-so began to mourn
and beat his breast, and he would not allow her to be
buried at once, in the hope that she might yet come
round; but this she never did. Meanwhile So-and-so
got slowly better, and by the end of six months was able
to walk again. He would often exclaim, “The ruin of
my career and the punishment I received&mdash;all this I
could have endured; but the loss of my dear A-lien is
more than I can bear.”<a id="Anchor-513" title="Go to Footnote 513" href="#Footnote-513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

CHANG PU-LIANG.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> trader who was travelling in the province
of Chih-li, being overtaken by a storm of rain and hail,
took shelter among some standing crops by the way-side.
There he heard a voice from heaven, saying, “These are
Chang Pu-liang’s fields; do not injure his crops.” The
trader began to wonder who this Chang Pu-liang could
be, and how, if he was <i>pu liang</i> (not virtuous), he came
to be under divine protection; so when the storm was
over and he had reached the neighbouring village, he
made enquiries on the subject, and told the people there
what he had heard. The villagers then informed him
that Chang Pu-liang was a very wealthy farmer, who was
accustomed every spring to make loans of grain to the
poor of the district, and who was not too particular
about getting back the exact amount he had lent,&mdash;taking,
in fact, whatever they brought him without discussion;
hence the sobriquet of <i>pu liang</i> “no measure” (<i>i.e.</i>, the
man who doesn’t measure the repayments of his loans).<a id="Anchor-516" title="Go to Footnote 516" href="#Footnote-516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-178"><a id="Page_ii-178"></a></span>
After that, they all proceeded in a body to the fields,
where it was discovered that vast damage had been done
to the crops generally, with the exception of Chang
Pu-liang’s, which had escaped uninjured.</p>

would not allow them, on account of their great numbers,

and the officer above-mentioned, thinking that this could
not be very large, acceded to their request. A carpet
was accordingly laid down, big enough for about two
people to stand on; but by dint of stretching, it was
soon enough for four or five; and so they went on,
stretching and stretching, until at last it covered about

a man. In great alarm, he got his pole quit of the
burden and struck about him right and left, whereupon
the body disappeared. He then hurried on to the next
village, and when he arrived there in the dusk of the
evening, he found several men holding lights to the
ground as if looking for something. On asking what
was the matter, they told him that while sitting together
a man’s head had fallen from the sky into their midst;
that they had noticed the hair and beard were all
draggled, but in a moment the head had vanished. The
woodsman then related what had happened to himself;
and thus one whole man was accounted for, though no

<p><span class="smallcaps">During</span> the reign of Shun Chih,<a id="Anchor-522" title="Go to Footnote 522" href="#Footnote-522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> of the people of
T‘êng-i, seven in ten were opposed to the Manchu
dynasty. The officials dared not touch them; and subsequently,
when the country became more settled, the
magistrates used to distinguish them from the others by
always deciding any cases in their favour: for they feared
lest these men should revert to their old opposition.
And thus it came about that one litigant would begin by
declaring himself to have been a “rebel,” while his adversary
would follow up by shewing such statement to be
false; so that before any case could be heard on its
actual merits, it was necessary to determine the status
both of plaintiff and defendant, whereby infinite labour
was entailed upon the Registrars.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that the yamên of one of the officials
was haunted by a fox, and the official’s daughter was

THEFT OF THE PEACH.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">When</span> I was a little boy I went one day to the prefectural
city.<a id="Anchor-523" title="Go to Footnote 523" href="#Footnote-523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> It was the time of the Spring festival,<a id="Anchor-524" title="Go to Footnote 524" href="#Footnote-524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>
and the custom was that on the day before, all the
merchants of the place should proceed with banners and
drums to the judge’s yamên: this was called “bringing
in the Spring.” I went with a friend to see the fun; the
crowd was immense, and there sat the officials in
crimson robes arranged right and left in the hall; but I
was small and didn’t know who they were, my attention
being attracted chiefly by the hum of voices and the
noise of the drums. In the middle of it all, a man
leading a boy with his hair unplaited and hanging down
his back, walked up to the dais. He carried a pole on
his shoulder, and appeared to be saying something which
I couldn’t hear for the noise; I only saw the officials
smile, and immediately afterwards an attendant came
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-187"><a id="Page_ii-187"></a></span>
down, and in a loud voice ordered the man to give a
performance. “What shall it be?” asked the man in
reply; whereupon, after some consultation between the
officials on the dais, the attendant inquired what he
could do best. The man said he could invert the order
of nature; and then, after another pause, he was instructed
to produce some peaches; to this he assented;
and taking off his coat, laid it on his box, at the same
time observing that they had set him a hard task, the
winter frost not having broken up, and adding that he
was afraid the gentlemen would be angry with him, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> His son here reminded him that he had agreed to
the task and couldn’t well get out of it; so, after fretting
and grumbling awhile, he cried out, “I have it! with
snow on the ground we shall never get peaches here;
but I guess there are some up in heaven in the Royal
Mother’s garden,<a id="Anchor-525" title="Go to Footnote 525" href="#Footnote-525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> and there we must try.” “How are
we to get up, father?” asked the boy; whereupon the
man said, “I have the means,” and immediately proceeded
to take from his box a cord some tens of feet in
length. This he carefully arranged, and then threw one
end of it high up into the air where it remained as if
caught by something. He now paid out the rope which
kept going up higher and higher until the end he had
thrown up disappeared in the clouds and only a short
piece was left in his hands. Calling his son, he then explained
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-188"><a id="Page_ii-188"></a></span>
that he himself was too heavy, and, handing him
the end of the rope, bid him go up at once. The boy,
however, made some difficulty, objecting that the rope
was too thin to bear his weight up to such a height, and
that he would surely fall down and be killed; upon
which his father said that his promise had been given
and that repentance was now too late, adding that if the
peaches were obtained they would surely be rewarded
with a hundred ounces of silver, which should be set
aside to get the boy a pretty wife. So his son seized the
rope and swarmed up, like a spider running up a thread
of its web; and in a few moments he was out of sight in
the clouds. By-and-by down fell a peach as large as a
basin, which the delighted father handed up to his
patrons on the dais who were some time coming to a
conclusion whether it was real or imitation. But just
then down came the rope with a run, and the affrighted
father shrieked out, “Alas! alas! some one has cut the
rope: what will my boy do now?” and in another
minute down fell something else, which was found on
examination to be his son’s head. “Ah me!” said he,
weeping bitterly and shewing the head; “the gardener
has caught him, and my boy is no more.” After that, his
arms, and legs, and body, all came down in like manner;
and the father, gathering them up, put them in the box
and said, “This was my only son, who accompanied me
everywhere; and now what a cruel fate is his. I must
away and bury him.” He then approached the dais and
said, “Your peach, gentlemen, was obtained at the cost
of my boy’s life; help me now to pay his funeral expenses,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-189"><a id="Page_ii-189"></a></span>
and I will be ever grateful to you.” The officials
who had been watching the scene in horror and amazement,
forthwith collected a good purse for him; and
when he had received the money, he rapped on his box
and said, “Pa-pa‘rh! why don’t you come out and thank
the gentlemen?” Thereupon, there was a thump on the
box from the inside and up came the boy himself, who
jumped out and bowed to the assembled company. I
have never forgotten this strange trick, which I subsequently
heard could be done by the White Lily sect,<a id="Anchor-526" title="Go to Footnote 526" href="#Footnote-526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>
who probably got it from this source.<a id="Anchor-527" title="Go to Footnote 527" href="#Footnote-527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

KILLING A SERPENT.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Ku-chi island in the eastern sea, there were
camellias of all colours which bloomed throughout the
year. No one, however, lived there, and very few
people ever visited the spot. One day, a young man of
Têng-chou, named Chang, who was fond of hunting and
adventure, hearing of the beauties of the place, put
together some wine and food, and rowed himself across
in a small open boat. The flowers were just then even
finer than usual, and their perfume was diffused for a
mile or so around; while many of the trees he saw were
several armfuls in circumference. So he roamed about
and gave himself up to enjoyment of the scene; and by-and-by
he opened a flask of wine, regretting very much
that he had no companion to share it with him, when all
of a sudden a most beautiful young girl, with extremely
bright eyes and dressed in red, stepped down from one
of the camellias before him.<a id="Anchor-528" title="Go to Footnote 528" href="#Footnote-528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> “Dear me!” said she on
seeing Mr. Chang; “I expected to be alone here, and
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-191"><a id="Page_ii-191"></a></span>
was not aware that the place was already occupied.”
Chang was somewhat alarmed at this apparition, and
asked the young lady whence she came; to which she
replied that her name was Chiao-ch‘ang, and that
she had accompanied thither a Mr. Hai, who had
gone off for a stroll and had left her to await his return.
Thereupon Chang begged her to join him in a cup of
wine, which she very willingly did, and they were just
beginning to enjoy themselves when a sound of rushing
wind was heard and the trees and plants bent beneath it.
“Here’s Mr. Hai!” cried the young lady; and jumping
quickly up, disappeared in a moment. The horrified
Chang now beheld a huge serpent coming out of the
bushes near by, and immediately ran behind a large tree
for shelter, hoping the reptile would not see him. But
the serpent advanced and enveloped both Chang and the
tree in its great folds, binding Chang’s arms down to his
sides so as to prevent him from moving them; and then
raising its head, darted out its tongue and bit the poor
man’s nose, causing the blood to flow freely out. This
blood it was quietly sucking up, when Chang, who
thought that his last hour had come, remembered that
he had in his pocket some fox poison; and managing to
insert a couple of fingers, he drew out the packet, broke
the paper, and let the powder lie in the palm of his
hand. He next leaned his hand over the serpent’s coils
in such a way that the blood from his nose dripped into
his hand, and when it was nearly full the serpent actually
did begin to drink it. And in a few moments the grip
was relaxed; the serpent struck the ground heavily with
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-192"><a id="Page_ii-192"></a></span>
its tail, and dashed away up against another tree, which
was broken in half, and then stretched itself out and
died. Chang was a long time unable to rise, but at
length he got up and carried the serpent off with him.
He was very ill for more than a month afterwards, and
even suspected the young lady of being a serpent, too, in
disguise.</p>

<br/>
THE RESUSCITATED CORPSE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> old man lived at Ts‘ai-tien, in the Yang-hsin
district. The village was some miles from the
district city, and he and his son kept a roadside inn
where travellers could pass the night. One day, as it
was getting dusk, four strangers presented themselves
and asked for a night’s lodging; to which the landlord
replied that every bed was already occupied. The four
men declared it was impossible for them to go back, and
urged him to take them in somehow; and at length the
landlord said he could give them a place to sleep in if
they were not too particular,&mdash;which the strangers immediately
assured him they were not. The fact was that
the old man’s daughter-in-law had just died, and that her
body was lying in the women’s quarters, waiting for the
coffin, which his son had gone away to buy. So the
landlord led them round thither, and walking in, placed
a lamp on the table. At the further end of the room lay
the corpse, decked out with paper robes, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, in the
usual way; and in the foremost section were sleeping-couches
for four people. The travellers were tired, and,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-194"><a id="Page_ii-194"></a></span>
throwing themselves on the beds, were soon snoring
loudly, with the exception of one of them, who was not
quite off when suddenly he heard a creaking of the
trestles on which the dead body was laid out, and, opening
his eyes, he saw by the light of the lamp in front of
the corpse that the girl was raising the coverings from
her and preparing to get down. In another moment she
was on the floor and advancing towards the sleepers.
Her face was of a light yellow hue, and she had a silk
kerchief round her head; and when she reached the
beds she blew on the other three travellers, whereupon
the fourth, in a great fright, stealthily drew up the bed-clothes
over his face, and held his breath to listen. He
heard her breathe on him as she had done on the others,
and then heard her go back again and get under the
paper robes, which rustled distinctly as she did so. He
now put out his head to take a peep, and saw that she
was lying down as before; whereupon, not daring to
make any noise, he stretched forth his foot and kicked
his companions, who, however, shewed no signs of
moving. He now determined to put on his clothes and
make a bolt for it; but he had hardly begun to do so
before he heard the creaking sound again, which sent
him back under the bed-clothes as fast as he could go.
Again the girl came to him, and breathing several times
on him, went away to lie down as before, as he could tell
by the noise of the trestles. He then put his hand very
gently out of bed, and, seizing his trousers, got quickly
into them, jumped up with a bound, and rushed out of
the place as fast as his legs would carry him. The
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-195"><a id="Page_ii-195"></a></span>
corpse, too, jumped up; but by this time the traveller
had already drawn the bolt, and was outside the door,
running along and shrieking at the top of his voice, with
the corpse following close behind. No one seemed to
hear him, and he was afraid to knock at the door of the
inn for fear they should not let him in in time; so he
made for the highway to the city, and after awhile he
saw a monastery by the roadside, and, hearing the
“wooden fish,”<a id="Anchor-529" title="Go to Footnote 529" href="#Footnote-529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> he ran up and thumped with all his
might at the gate. The priest, however, did not know
what to make of it, and would not open to him; and as
the corpse was only a few yards off, he could do nothing
but run behind a tree which stood close by, and there
shelter himself, dodging to the right as the corpse
dodged to the left, and so on. This infuriated the dead
girl to madness; and at length, as tired and panting they
stood watching each other on opposite sides of the tree,
the corpse made a rush forward with one arm on each
side in the hope of thus grabbing its victim. The traveller,
however, fell backwards and escaped, while the
corpse remained rigidly embracing the tree. By-and-by
the priest, who had been listening from the inside, hearing
no sounds for some time, came out and found the
traveller lying senseless on the ground; whereupon he
had him carried into the monastery, and by morning
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-196"><a id="Page_ii-196"></a></span>
they had got him round again. After giving him a little
broth to drink, he related the whole story; and then in
the early dawn they went out to examine the tree, where
they found the girl fixed tightly to the tree. The news
being sent to the magistrate, that functionary attended at
once in person,<a id="Anchor-530" title="Go to Footnote 530" href="#Footnote-530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> and gave orders to remove the body;
but this they were at first unable to do, the girl’s fingers
having penetrated into the bark so far that her nails were
not to be seen. At length they got her away, and then
a messenger was despatched to the inn, already in a state
of great commotion over the three travellers, who had
been found dead in their beds. The old man accordingly
sent to fetch his daughter-in-law; and the surviving
traveller petitioned the magistrate, saying, “Four of us
left home, but only one will go back. Give me something
that I may show to my fellow-townsmen.” So the
magistrate gave him a certificate and sent him home
again.<a id="Anchor-531" title="Go to Footnote 531" href="#Footnote-531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<br/>
THE FISHERMAN AND HIS FRIEND.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">In</span> the northern parts of Tzŭ-chou there lived a man
named Hsü, a fisherman by trade. Every night when
he went to fish he would carry some wine with him, and
drink and fish by turns, always taking care to pour out a
libation on the ground, accompanied by the following
invocation:&mdash;“Drink too, ye drowned spirits of the
river!” Such was his regular custom; and it was also
noticeable that, even on occasions when the other fishermen
caught nothing, he always got a full basket. One
night, as he was sitting drinking by himself, a young man
suddenly appeared and began walking up and down near
him. Hsü offered him a cup of wine, which was readily
accepted, and they remained chatting together throughout
the night, Hsü meanwhile not catching a single fish.
However, just as he was giving up all hope of doing
anything, the young man rose and said he would go
a little way down the stream and beat them up towards
Hsü, which he accordingly did, returning in a
few minutes and warning him to be on the look-out.
Hsü now heard a noise like that of a shoal coming up
the stream, and, casting his net, made a splendid haul,&mdash;all
that he caught being over a foot in length. Greatly
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-198"><a id="Page_ii-198"></a></span>
delighted, he now prepared to go home, first offering his
companion a share of the fish, which the latter declined,
saying that he had often received kindnesses from Mr.
Hsü, and that he would <a id="tn_18">be</a> only too happy to help him
regularly in the same manner if Mr. Hsü would accept
his assistance. The latter replied that he did not recollect
ever meeting him before, and that he should be
much obliged for any aid the young man might choose
to afford him; regretting, at the same time, his inability
to make him any adequate return. He then asked the
young man his name and surname; and the young man
said his surname was Wang, adding that Hsü might
address him when they met as Wang Liu-lang, he having
no other name. Thereupon they parted, and the next
day Hsü sold his fish and bought some more wine, with
which he repaired as usual to the river bank. There he
found his companion already awaiting him, and they
spent the night together in precisely the same way as the
preceding one, the young man beating up the fish for
him as before. This went on for some months, until at
length one evening the young man, with many expressions
of his thanks and his regrets, told Hsü that
they were about to part for ever. Much alarmed by the
melancholy tone in which his friend had communicated
this news, Hsü was on the point of asking for an explanation,
when the young man stopped him, and himself
proceeded as follows:&mdash;“The friendship that has grown
up between us is truly surprising; and, now that we shall
meet no more, there is no harm in telling you the whole
truth. I am a disembodied spirit&mdash;the soul of one who
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-199"><a id="Page_ii-199"></a></span>
was drowned in this river when tipsy. I have been here
many years, and your former success in fishing was due
to the fact that I used secretly to beat up the fish towards
you, in return for the libations you were accustomed
to pour out. To-morrow my time is up: my
substitute will arrive, and I shall be born again in the
world of mortals.<a id="Anchor-532" title="Go to Footnote 532" href="#Footnote-532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> We have but this one evening left,
and I therefore take advantage of it to express my feelings
to you.” On hearing these words, Hsü was at
first very much alarmed; however, he had grown so
accustomed to his friend’s society, that his fears soon
passed away; and, filling up a goblet, he said, with a
sigh, “Liu-lang, old fellow, drink this up, and away with
melancholy. It’s hard to lose you; but I’m glad enough
for your sake, and won’t think of my own sorrow.” He
then inquired of Liu-lang who was to be his substitute;
to which the latter replied, “Come to the river-bank
to-morrow afternoon and you’ll see a woman drowned:
she is the one.” Just then the village cocks began to
crow, and, with tears in their eyes, the two friends bade
each other farewell.</p>

<p>Next day Hsü waited on the river bank to see if anything
would happen, and lo! a woman carrying a child
in her arms came along. When close to the edge of the
river, she stumbled and fell into the water, managing,
however, to throw the child safely on to the bank, where
it lay kicking and sprawling and crying at the top of its
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-200"><a id="Page_ii-200"></a></span>
voice. The woman herself sank and rose several times,
until at last she succeeded in clutching hold of the bank
and pulled herself, dripping, out; and then, after resting
awhile, she picked up the child and went on her way.
All this time Hsü had been in a great state of excitement,
and was on the point of running to help the
woman out of the water; but he remembered that she
was to be the substitute of his friend, and accordingly
restrained himself from doing so.<a id="Anchor-533" title="Go to Footnote 533" href="#Footnote-533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> Then when he saw
the woman get out by herself, he began to suspect that
Liu-lang’s words had not been fulfilled. That night he
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-201"><a id="Page_ii-201"></a></span>
went to fish as usual, and before long the young man
arrived and said, “We meet once again: there is
no need now to speak of separation.” Hsü asked him
how it was so; to which he replied, “The woman you
saw had already taken my place, but I could not bear to
hear the child cry, and I saw that my one life would be
purchased at the expense of their two lives, wherefore I
let her go, and now I cannot say when I shall have
another chance.<a id="Anchor-534" title="Go to Footnote 534" href="#Footnote-534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> The union of our destinies may
not yet be worked out.” “Alas!” sighed Hsü, “this
noble conduct of yours is enough to move God Almighty.”</p>

<p>After this the two friends went on much as they had
done before, until one day Liu-lang again said he had
come to bid Hsü farewell. Hsü thought he had found
another substitute, but Liu-lang told him that his
former behaviour had so pleased Almighty Heaven,
that he had been appointed guardian angel of Wu-chên,
in the Chao-yüan district, and that on the
following morning he would start for his new post.
“And if you do not forget the days of our friendship,”
added he, “I pray you come and see me, in spite of the
long journey.” “Truly,” replied Hsü, “you well deserved
to be made a God; but the paths of Gods and
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-202"><a id="Page_ii-202"></a></span>
men lie in different directions, and even if the distance
were nothing, how should I manage to meet you
again?” “Don’t be afraid on that score,” said Liu-lang,
“but come;” and then he went away, and Hsü
returned home. The latter immediately began to prepare
for the journey, which caused his wife to laugh at
him and say, “Supposing you do find such a place at
the end of that long journey, you won’t be able to hold
a conversation with a clay image.” Hsü, however, paid
no attention to her remarks, and travelled straight to
Chao-yüan, where he learned from the inhabitants that
there really was a village called Wu-chên, whither he
forthwith proceeded and took up his abode at an inn.
He then inquired of the landlord where the village
temple was; to which the latter replied by asking him
somewhat hurriedly if he was speaking to Mr. Hsü.
Hsü informed him that his name was Hsü, asking in
reply how he came to know it; whereupon the landlord
further inquired if his native place was not Tzŭ-chou.
Hsü told him it was, and again asked him how he knew
all this; to which the landlord made no answer, but
rushed out of the room; and in a few moments the
place was crowded with old and young, men, women,
and children, all come to visit Hsü. They then told
him that a few nights before they had seen their guardian
deity in a vision, and he had informed them that Mr. Hsü
would shortly arrive, and had bidden them to provide
him with travelling expenses, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Hsü was very much
astonished at this, and went off at once to the shrine,
where he invoked his friend as follows:&mdash;“Ever since we
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-203"><a id="Page_ii-203"></a></span>
parted I have had you daily and nightly in my thoughts;
and now that I have fulfilled my promise of coming to
see you, I have to thank you for the orders you have
issued to the people of the place. As for me, I have
nothing to offer you but a cup of wine, which I pray
you accept as though we were drinking together on the
river-bank.” He then burnt a quantity of paper money,<a id="Anchor-535" title="Go to Footnote 535" href="#Footnote-535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>
when lo! a wind suddenly arose, which, after whirling
round and round behind the shrine, soon dropped, and
all was still. That night Hsü dreamed that his friend
came to him, dressed in his official cap and robes, and
very different in appearance from what he used to be,
and thanked him, saying, “It is truly kind of you to
visit me thus: I only regret that my position makes me
unable to meet you face to face, and that though near
we are still so far. The people here will give you a trifle,
which pray accept for my sake; and when you go away,
I will see you a short way on your journey.” A few
days afterwards Hsü prepared to start, in spite of the
numerous invitations to stay which poured in upon him
from all sides; and then the inhabitants loaded him with
presents of all kinds, and escorted him out of the
village. There a whirlwind arose and accompanied
him several miles, when he turned round and invoked
his friend thus:&mdash;“Liu-lang, take care of your valued
person. Do not trouble yourself to come any farther.<a id="Anchor-536" title="Go to Footnote 536" href="#Footnote-536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-204"><a id="Page_ii-204"></a></span>
Your noble heart will ensure happiness to this district,
and there is no occasion for me to give a word of advice
to my old friend.” By-and-by the whirlwind ceased, and
the villagers, who were much astonished, returned to
their own homes. Hsü, too, travelled homewards, and
being now a man of some means, ceased to work any
more as a fisherman. And whenever he met a Chao-yüan
man he would ask him about that guardian angel,
being always informed in reply that he was a most
beneficent God. Some say the place was Shih-k‘êng-chuang,
in Chang-ch‘in: I can’t say which it was
myself.</p>

<br/>
THE PRIEST’S WARNING.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A man</span> named Chang died suddenly, and was escorted
at once by devil-lictors<a id="Anchor-537" title="Go to Footnote 537" href="#Footnote-537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> into the presence of the King
of Purgatory. His Majesty turned to Chang’s record of
good and evil, and then, in great anger, told the lictors
they had brought the wrong man, and bade them take
him back again. As they left the judgment-hall, Chang
persuaded his escort to let him have a look at Purgatory;
and, accordingly, the devils conducted him
through the nine sections,<a id="Anchor-538" title="Go to Footnote 538" href="#Footnote-538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> pointing out to him the
Knife Hill,<a id="Anchor-539" title="Go to Footnote 539" href="#Footnote-539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> the Sword Tree, and other objects of interest.
By-and-by, they reached a place where there
was a Buddhist priest, hanging suspended in the air
head downwards, by a rope through a hole in his leg.
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-206"><a id="Page_ii-206"></a></span>
He was shrieking with pain, and longing for death; and
when Chang approached, lo! he saw that it was his
own brother. In great distress, he asked his guides the
reason of this punishment; and they informed him that
the priest was suffering thus for collecting subscriptions
on behalf of his order, and then privately squandering
the proceeds in gambling and debauchery.<a id="Anchor-540" title="Go to Footnote 540" href="#Footnote-540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
“Nor,” added they, “will he escape this torment unless
he repents him of his misdeeds.” When Chang came
round,<a id="Anchor-541" title="Go to Footnote 541" href="#Footnote-541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> he thought his brother was already dead, and
hurried off to the Hsing-fu monastery, to which the
latter belonged. As he went in at the door, he heard
a loud shrieking; and, on proceeding to his brother’s
room, he found him laid up with a very bad abscess in
his leg, the leg itself being tied up above him to the
wall, this being, as his brother informed him, the only
bearable position in which he could lie. Chang now
told him what he had seen in Purgatory, at which the
priest was so terrified, that he at once gave up taking
wine and meat,<a id="Anchor-542" title="Go to Footnote 542" href="#Footnote-542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> and devoted himself entirely to religious
exercises. In a fortnight he was well, and was
known ever afterwards as a most exemplary priest.</p>

METEMPSYCHOSIS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Lin</span>, who took his master’s degree in the same
year as the late Mr. Wên Pi,<a id="Anchor-543" title="Go to Footnote 543" href="#Footnote-543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> could remember what had
happened to him in his previous state of existence, and
once told the whole story, as follows:&mdash;I was originally
of a good family, but, after leading a very dissolute life,
I died at the age of sixty-two. On being conducted
into the presence of the King of Purgatory, he received
me civilly, bade me be seated, and offered me a cup of
tea. I noticed, however, that the tea in His Majesty’s
cup was clear and limpid, while that in my own was
muddy, like the lees of wine. It then flashed across
me that this was the potion which was given to all disembodied
spirits to render them oblivious of the past:<a id="Anchor-544" title="Go to Footnote 544" href="#Footnote-544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-208"><a id="Page_ii-208"></a></span>
and, <a id="tn_19">accordingly</a>, when the King was looking the other
way, I seized the opportunity of pouring it under the
table, pretending afterwards that I had drunk it all up.
My record of good and evil was now presented for
inspection, and when the King saw what it was, he
flew into a great passion, and ordered the attendant
devils to drag me away, and send me back to earth as a
horse. I was immediately seized and bound, and the
devils carried me off to a house, the door-sill of which
was so high I could not step over it. While I was
trying to do so, the devils behind lashed me with all
their might, causing me such pain that I made a great
spring, and&mdash;lo and behold! I was a horse in a stable.
“The mare has got a nice colt,” I then heard a man
call out; but, although I was perfectly aware of all that
was passing, I could say nothing myself. Hunger now
came upon me, and I was glad to be suckled by the
mare; and by the end of four or five years I had grown
into a fine strong horse, dreadfully afraid of the whip,
and running away at the very sight of it. When my
master rode me, it was always with a saddle-cloth, and at
a leisurely pace, which was bearable enough; but when
the servants mounted me barebacked, and dug their
heels into me, the pain struck into my vitals; and at
length I refused all food, and in three days I died.
Reappearing before the King of Purgatory, His Majesty
was enraged to find that I had thus tried to shirk
working out my time; and, flaying me forthwith, condemned
me to go back again as a dog. And when I
did not move, the devils came behind me and lashed
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-209"><a id="Page_ii-209"></a></span>
me until I ran away from them into the open country,
where, thinking I had better die right off, I jumped over
a cliff, and lay at the bottom unable to move. I then
saw that I was among a litter of puppies, and that an old
bitch was licking and suckling me by turns; whereby I
knew that I was once more among mortals. In this
hateful form I continued for some time, longing to kill
myself, and yet fearing to incur the penalty of shirking.
At length, I purposely bit my master in the leg, and tore
him badly; whereupon he had me destroyed, and I
was taken again into the presence of the King, who was
so displeased with my vicious behaviour that he condemned
me to become a snake, and shut me up in a
dark room, where I could see nothing. After a while I
managed to climb up the wall, bore a hole in the roof,
and escape; and immediately I found myself lying in
the grass, a veritable snake. Then I registered a vow
that I would harm no living thing, and I lived for
some years, feeding upon berries and such like, ever
remembering neither to take my own life, nor by injuring
any one to incite them to take it, but longing all
the while for the happy release, which did not come to
me. One day, as I was sleeping in the grass, I heard
the noise of a passing cart, and, on trying to get across
the road out of its way, I was caught by the wheel, and
cut in two. The King was astonished to see me back
so soon, but I humbly told my story, and, in pity for the
innocent creature that loses its life, he pardoned me,
and permitted me to be born again at my appointed time
as a human being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="ii-210"><a id="Page_ii-210"></a></span>
Such was Mr. Lin’s story. He could speak as soon as
he came into the world; and could repeat anything he
had once read. In the year 1621 he took his master’s
degree, and was never tired of telling people to put
saddle-cloths on their horses, and recollect that the pain
of being gripped by the knees is even worse than the
lash itself.</p>

THE FORTY STRINGS OF CASH.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Justice Wang</span> had a steward, who was possessed
of considerable means. One night the latter dreamt
that a man rushed in and said to him, “To-day you
must repay me those forty strings of cash.” The
steward asked who he was; to which the man made no
answer, but hurried past him into the women’s apartments.
When the steward awoke, he found that his
wife had been delivered of a son; and, knowing at once
that retribution was at hand, he set aside forty strings
of cash to be spent solely in food, clothes, medicines,
and so on, for the baby. By the time the child
was between three and four years old, the steward
found that of the forty strings only about seven hundred
cash remained; and when the wet-nurse, who happened
to be standing by, brought the child and dandled it in
her arms before him, he looked at it and said, “The
forty strings are all but repaid; it is time you were off
again.” Thereupon the child changed colour; its head
fell back, and its eyes stared fixedly, and, when they
tried to revive it, lo! respiration had already ceased.
The father then took the balance of the forty strings,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-212"><a id="Page_ii-212"></a></span>
and with it defrayed the child’s funeral expenses&mdash;truly
a warning to people to be sure and pay their debts.</p>

<p>Formerly, an old childless man consulted a great
many Buddhist priests on the subject. One of them
said to him, “If you owe no one anything, and no one
owes you anything, how can you expect to have
children? A good son is the repayment of a former
debt; a bad son is a dunning creditor, at whose birth
there is no rejoicing, at whose death no lamentations.”<a id="Anchor-545" title="Go to Footnote 545" href="#Footnote-545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

SAVING LIFE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> gentleman of Shên-yu, who had taken
the highest degree, could remember himself in a previous
state of existence. He said he had formerly
been a scholar, and had died in middle life; and that
when he appeared before the Judge of Purgatory, there
stood the cauldrons, the boiling oil, and other apparatus
of torture, exactly as we read about them on earth. In
the eastern corner of the hall were a number of frames
from which hung the skins of sheep, dogs, oxen,
horses, etc.; and when anybody was condemned to re-appear
in life under any one of these forms, his skin
was stripped off and a skin was taken from the proper
frame and fixed on to his body. The gentleman of
whom I am writing heard himself sentenced to become
a sheep; and the attendant devils had already clothed
him in a sheep’s-skin in the manner above described,
when the clerk of the record informed the Judge that
the criminal before him had once saved another man’s
life. The Judge consulted his books, and forthwith
cried out, “I pardon him; for although his sins have
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-214"><a id="Page_ii-214"></a></span>
been many, this one act has redeemed them all.”<a id="Anchor-546" title="Go to Footnote 546" href="#Footnote-546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> The
devils then tried to take off the sheep’s-skin, but it was
so tightly stuck on him that they couldn’t move it.
However, after great efforts, and causing the gentleman
most excruciating agony, they managed to tear it off
bit by bit, though not quite so cleanly as one might
have wished. In fact, a piece as big as the palm of
a man’s hand was left near his shoulder; and when
he was born again into the world, there was a great
patch of hair on his back, which grew again as fast as
it was cut off.</p>

<br/>
THE SALT SMUGGLER.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Wang Shih</span>, of Kao-wan, a petty salt huckster, was
inordinately fond of gambling. One night he was
arrested by two men, whom he took for lictors of the
Salt Gabelle; and, flinging down what salt he had with
him, he tried to make his escape.<a id="Anchor-547" title="Go to Footnote 547" href="#Footnote-547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> He found, however,
that his legs would not move with him, and he was
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-216"><a id="Page_ii-216"></a></span>
forthwith seized and bound. “We are not sent by the
Salt Commissioner,” cried his captors, in reply to an
entreaty to set him free; “we are the devil-constables of
Purgatory.” Wang was horribly frightened at this, and
begged the devils to let him bid farewell to his wife
and children; but this they refused to do, saying, “You
aren’t going to die; you are only wanted for a little job
there is down below.” Wang asked what the job was;
to which the devils replied, “A new Judge has come
into office, and, finding the river<a id="Anchor-548" title="Go to Footnote 548" href="#Footnote-548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> and the eighteen hells
choked up with the bodies of sinners, he has determined
to employ three classes of mortals to clean them out.
These are thieves, unlicensed founders,<a id="Anchor-549" title="Go to Footnote 549" href="#Footnote-549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> and unlicensed
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-217"><a id="Page_ii-217"></a></span>
dealers in salt, and, for the dirtiest work of all, he is
going to take musicians.”<a id="Anchor-550" title="Go to Footnote 550" href="#Footnote-550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p>Wang accompanied the devils until at length they
reached a city, where he was brought before the Judge,
who was sitting in his Judgment-hall. On turning
up his record in the books, one of the devils explained
that the prisoner had been arrested for
unlicensed trading; whereupon the Judge became very
angry, and said, “Those who drive an illicit trade in
salt, not only defraud the State of its proper revenue,
but also prey upon the livelihood of the people. Those,
however, whom the greedy officials and corrupt traders
of to-day denounce as unlicensed traders, are among the
most virtuous of mankind&mdash;needy unfortunates who
struggle to save a few cash in the purchase of their
pint of salt.<a id="Anchor-551" title="Go to Footnote 551" href="#Footnote-551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> Are they your unlicensed traders?” The
Judge then bade the lictors buy four pecks of salt, and
send it to Wang’s house for him, together with that
which had been found upon him; and, at the same
time, he gave Wang an iron scourge, and told him to
superintend the works at the river. So Wang followed
the devils, and found the river swarming with people
like ants in an ant-hill. The water was turbid and red,
the stench from it being almost unbearable, while those
who were employed in cleaning it out were working
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-218"><a id="Page_ii-218"></a></span>
there naked. Sometimes they would sink down in the
horrid mass of decaying bodies: sometimes they would
get lazy, and then the iron scourge was applied to their
backs. The assistant-superintendents had small scented
balls, which they held in their mouths. Wang himself
approached the bank, and saw the licensed salt-merchant
of Kao-wan<a id="Anchor-552" title="Go to Footnote 552" href="#Footnote-552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> in the midst of it all, and thrashed him
well with his scourge, until he was afraid he would
never come up again. This went on for three days
and three nights, by which time half the workmen were
dead, and the work completed; whereupon the same
two devils escorted him home again, and then he
waked up.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Wang had gone out to sell some
salt, and had not come back. Next morning, when his
wife opened the house door, she found two bags of salt
in the court-yard; and, as her husband did not return,
she sent off some people to search for him, and they
discovered him lying senseless by the wayside. He was
immediately conveyed home, where, after a little time,
he recovered consciousness, and related what had taken
place. Strange to say, the licensed salt-merchant had
fallen down in a fit on the previous evening, and had only
just recovered; and Wang, hearing that his body was
covered with sores&mdash;the result of the beating with the
iron scourge&mdash;went off to his house to see him; however,
directly the wretched man set eyes on Wang, he
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-219"><a id="Page_ii-219"></a></span>
hastily covered himself up with the bed-clothes, forgetting
that they were no longer at the infernal river.
He did not recover from his injuries for a year, after
which he retired from trade.<a id="Anchor-553" title="Go to Footnote 553" href="#Footnote-553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<br/>
COLLECTING SUBSCRIPTIONS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">The</span> Frog-God frequently employs a magician to
deliver its oracles to those who have faith. Should the
magician declare that the God is pleased, happiness is
sure to follow; but if he says the God is angry, women
and children<a id="Anchor-554" title="Go to Footnote 554" href="#Footnote-554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> sit sorrowfully about, and neglect even
their meals. Such is the customary belief, and it is
probably not altogether devoid of foundation.</p>

<p>There was a certain wealthy merchant, named Chou,
who was a very stingy man. Once, when some repairs
were necessary to the temple of the God of War,<a id="Anchor-555" title="Go to Footnote 555" href="#Footnote-555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> and
rich and poor were subscribing as much as each could
afford, he alone gave nothing.<a id="Anchor-556" title="Go to Footnote 556" href="#Footnote-556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> By-and-by the works
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-221"><a id="Page_ii-221"></a></span>
were stopped for want of funds, and the committee
of management were at a loss what to do next. It
happened that just then there was a festival in honour
of the Frog-God, at which the magician suddenly cried
out, “General Chou<a id="Anchor-557" title="Go to Footnote 557" href="#Footnote-557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> has given orders for a further
subscription. Bring forth the books.” The people all
shouting assent to this, the magician went on to say,
“Those who have already subscribed will not be compelled
to do so again; those who have not subscribed
must give according to their means.” Thereupon
various persons began to put down their names, and
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-222"><a id="Page_ii-222"></a></span>
when this was finished, the magician examined the
books. He then asked if Mr. Chou was present; and
the latter, who was skulking behind, in dread lest he
should be detected by the God, had no alternative but
to come to the front. “Put yourself down for one
hundred taels,” said the magician to him; and when
Chou hesitated, he cried out to him in anger, “You
could give two hundred for your own bad purposes: how
much more should you do so in a good cause?” alluding
to a scandalous intrigue of Chou’s, the consequences of
which he had averted by payment of the sum mentioned.
This put our friend to the blush, and he was
obliged to enter his name for one hundred taels, at which
his wife was very angry, and said the magician was a
rogue, and whenever he came to collect the money he
was put off with some excuse.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Chou was one day going to sleep,
when he heard a noise outside his house, like the blowing
of an ox, and beheld a huge frog walking leisurely
through the front door, which was just big enough to
let it pass. Once inside, the creature laid itself down
to sleep, with its head on the threshold, to the great
horror of all the inmates; upon which Chou observed
that it had probably come to collect his subscription,
and burning some incense, he vowed that he would
pay down thirty taels on the spot, and send the balance
later on. The frog, however, did not move, so Chou
promised fifty, and then there was a slight decrease in
the frog’s size. Another twenty brought it down to
the size of a peck measure; and when Chou said the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-223"><a id="Page_ii-223"></a></span>
full amount should be paid on the spot, the frog became
suddenly no larger than one’s fist, and disappeared
through a hole in the wall. Chou immediately sent off
fifty taels, at which all the other subscribers were much
astonished, not knowing what had taken place. A few
days afterwards the magician said Chou still owed fifty
taels, and that he had better send it in soon; so Chou
forwarded ten more, hoping now to have done with
the matter. However, as he and his wife were one day
sitting down to dinner, the frog reappeared, and glaring
with anger, took up a position on the bed, which creaked
under it, as though unable to bear the weight. Putting
its head on the pillow, the frog went off to sleep, its
body gradually swelling up until it was as big as a
buffalo, and nearly filled the room, causing Chou to send
off the balance of his subscription without a moment’s
delay. There was now no diminution in the size of the
frog’s body; and by-and-by crowds of small frogs came
hopping in, boring through the walls, jumping on the
bed, catching flies on the cooking-stove, and dying in
the saucepans, until the place was quite unbearable.
Three days passed thus, and then Chou sought out the
magician, and asked him what was to be done. The
latter said he could manage it, and began by vowing on
behalf of Chou twenty more taels’ subscription. At
this the frog raised its head, and a further increase
caused it to move one foot; and by the time a hundred
taels was reached, the frog was walking out of the door.
At the door, however, it stopped, and lay down once
more, which the magician explained by saying, that
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-224"><a id="Page_ii-224"></a></span>
immediate payment was required; so Chou handed over
the amount at once, and the frog, shrinking down to
its usual size, mingled with its companions, and departed
with them.</p>

<p>The repairs to the temple were accordingly completed,
but for “lighting the eyes,”<a id="Anchor-558" title="Go to Footnote 558" href="#Footnote-558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> and the attendant
festivities, some further subscriptions were wanted.
Suddenly, the magician, pointing at the managers, cried
out, “There is money short; of fifteen men, two of you
are defaulters.” At this, all declared they had given
what they could afford; but the magician went on to
say, “It is not a question of what you can afford; you
have misappropriated the funds<a id="Anchor-559" title="Go to Footnote 559" href="#Footnote-559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> that should not have
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-225"><a id="Page_ii-225"></a></span>
been touched, and misfortune would come upon you,
but that, in return for your exertions, I shall endeavour
to avert it from you. The magician himself is not
without taint.<a id="Anchor-560" title="Go to Footnote 560" href="#Footnote-560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> Let him set you a good example.”
Thereupon, the magician rushed into his house, and
brought out all the money he had, saying, “I stole eight
taels myself, which I will now refund.” He then
weighed what silver he had, and finding that it only
amounted to a little over six taels, he made one of the
bystanders take a note of the difference. Then the
others came forward and paid up, each what he had
misappropriated from the public fund. All this time
the magician had been in a divine ecstasy, not knowing
what he was saying; and when he came round, and
was told what had happened, his shame knew no
bounds, so he pawned some of his clothes, and paid in
the balance of his own debt. As to the two defaulters
who did not pay, one of them was ill for a month and
more; while the other had a bad attack of boils.</p>

<br/>
TAOIST MIRACLES.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Chi-nan Fu there lived a certain priest: I cannot
say whence he came, or what was his name. Winter
and summer alike he wore but one unlined robe, and
a yellow girdle about his waist, with neither shirt nor
trousers. He combed his hair with a broken comb,
holding the ends in his mouth, like the strings of a
hat. By day he wandered about the market-place; at
night he slept in the street, and to a distance of several
feet round where he lay, the ice and snow would melt.
When he first arrived at Chi-nan he used to perform
miracles, and the people vied with each other in making
him presents. One day a disreputable young fellow
gave him a quantity of wine, and begged him in return
to divulge the secret of his power; and when the priest
refused, the young man watched him get into the river
to bathe, and then ran off with his clothes. The priest
called out to him to bring them back, promising that
he would do as the young man required; but the latter,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-227"><a id="Page_ii-227"></a></span>
distrusting the priest’s good faith, refused to do so;
whereupon the priest’s girdle was forthwith changed into
a snake, several spans in circumference, which coiled itself
round its master’s head, and glared and hissed terribly.
The young man now fell on his knees, and humbly
prayed the priest to save his life; at which the priest put
his girdle on again, and a snake that had appeared to be
his girdle, wriggled away and disappeared. The priest’s
fame was thus firmly established, and the gentry and
officials of the place were constantly inviting him to join
them in their festive parties. By-and-by the priest said
he was going to invite his entertainers to a return feast;<a id="Anchor-561" title="Go to Footnote 561" href="#Footnote-561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>
and at the appointed time each one of them found
on his table a formal invitation to a banquet at the
Water Pavilion, but no one knew who had brought the
letters. However, they all went, and were met at the
door by the priest, in his usual garb; and when they got
inside, the place was all desolate and bare, with no
banquet ready. “I’m afraid I shall be obliged to ask
you gentlemen to let me use your attendants,” said the
priest to his guests; “I am a poor man, and keep no
servants myself.” To this all readily consented; whereupon
the priest drew a double door upon the wall, and
rapped upon it with his knuckles. Somebody answered
from within, and immediately the door was thrown open,
and a splendid array of handsome chairs, and tables
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-228"><a id="Page_ii-228"></a></span>
loaded with exquisite viands and costly wines, burst
upon the gaze of the astonished guests. The priest
bade the attendants receive all these things from the
door, and bring them outside, cautioning them on no
account to speak with the people inside; and thus
a most luxurious entertainment was provided to the
great amazement of all present.</p>

<p>Now this Pavilion stood upon the bank of a small
lake, and every year, at the proper season, it was literally
covered with lilies; but, at the time of this feast, the
weather was cold, and the surface of the lake was of
a smoky green colour. “It’s a pity,” said one of the
guests, “that the lilies are not out”&mdash;a sentiment in
which the others very cordially agreed, when suddenly a
servant came running in to say that, at that moment, the
lake was a perfect mass of lilies. Every one jumped up
directly, and ran to look out of the window, and, lo! it
was so; and in another minute the fragrant perfume
of the flowers was borne towards them by the breeze.
Hardly knowing what to make of this strange sight,
they sent off some servants, in a boat, to gather a few
of the lilies, but they soon returned empty-handed,
saying, that the flowers seemed to shift their position
as fast as they rowed towards them; at which the priest
laughed, and said, “These are but the lilies of your
imagination, and have no real existence.” And later
on, when the wine was finished, the flowers began to
droop and fade; and by-and-by a breeze from the north
carried off every sign of them, leaving the lake as it had
been before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="ii-229"><a id="Page_ii-229"></a></span>
A certain Taot‘ai,<a id="Anchor-562" title="Go to Footnote 562" href="#Footnote-562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> at Chi-nan, was much taken with
this priest, and gave him rooms at his yamên. One day,
he had some friends to dinner, and set before them
some very choice old wine that he had, and of which
he only brought out a small quantity at a time, not
wishing to get through it too rapidly. The guests,
however, liked it so much that they asked for more;
upon which the Taot‘ai said, “he was very sorry, but it
was all finished.” The priest smiled at this, and said,
“I can give the gentlemen some, if they will oblige me
by accepting it;” and immediately inserted the wine-kettle<a id="Anchor-563" title="Go to Footnote 563" href="#Footnote-563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>
in his sleeve, bringing it out again directly, and
pouring out for the guests. This wine tasted exactly
like the choice wine they had just been drinking, and
the priest gave them all as much of it as they wanted,
which made the Taot‘ai suspect that something was
wrong; so, after the dinner, he went into his cellar to
look at his own stock, when he found the jars closely
tied down, with unbroken seals, but one and all empty.
In a great rage, he caused the priest to be arrested for
sorcery, and proceeded to have him bambooed; but no
sooner had the bamboo touched the priest than the
Taot‘ai himself felt a sting of pain, which increased
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-230"><a id="Page_ii-230"></a></span>
at every blow; and, in a few moments, there was the
priest writhing and shrieking under every cut,<a id="Anchor-564" title="Go to Footnote 564" href="#Footnote-564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> while
the Taot‘ai was sitting in a pool of blood. Accordingly,
the punishment was soon stopped, and the priest was
commanded to leave Chi-nan, which he did, and I
know not whither he went. He was subsequently
seen at Nanking, dressed precisely as of old; but on
being spoken to, he only smiled and made no reply.</p>

ARRIVAL OF BUDDHIST PRIESTS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Two</span> Buddhist priests having arrived from the West,<a id="Anchor-565" title="Go to Footnote 565" href="#Footnote-565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
one went to the Wu-t‘ai hill, while the other hung up his
staff<a id="Anchor-566" title="Go to Footnote 566" href="#Footnote-566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> at T‘ai-shan. Their clothes, complexions, language,
and features, were very different from those of
our country. They further said they had crossed the
Fiery Mountains, from the peaks of which smoke was
always issuing as from the chimney of a furnace; that
they could only travel after rain, and that excessive
caution was necessary to avoid displacing any stone and
thus giving a vent to the flames. They also stated that
they had passed through the River of Sand, in the
middle of which was a crystal hill with perpendicular
sides and perfectly transparent; and that there was a defile
just broad enough to admit a single cart, its entrance
guarded by two dragons with crossed horns. Those
who wished to pass prostrated themselves before these
dragons, and on receiving permission to enter, the horns
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-232"><a id="Page_ii-232"></a></span>
opened and let them through. The dragons were of a
white colour, and their scales and bristles seemed to be
of crystal. Eighteen winters and summers these priests
had been on the road; and of twelve who started from
the west together, only two reached China.<a id="Anchor-567" title="Go to Footnote 567" href="#Footnote-567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> These two
said that in their country four of our mountains are held
in great esteem, namely, T‘ai, Hua, Wu-t‘ai, and Lo-chia.
The people there also think that China<a id="Anchor-568" title="Go to Footnote 568" href="#Footnote-568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> is paved with
yellow gold, that Kuan-yin and Wên-shu<a id="Anchor-569" title="Go to Footnote 569" href="#Footnote-569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> are still alive,
and that they have only come here to be sure of their
Buddhahood and of immortal life. Hearing these
words it struck me that this was precisely what our own
people say and think about the West; and that if
travellers from each country could only meet half way
and tell each other the true state of affairs, there would
be some hearty laughter on both sides, and a saving of
much unnecessary trouble.</p>

THE STOLEN EYES.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">When</span> His Excellency Mr. T‘ang, of our village, was
quite a child, a relative of his took him to a temple to
see the usual theatrical performances.<a id="Anchor-570" title="Go to Footnote 570" href="#Footnote-570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> He was a clever
little fellow, afraid of nothing and nobody; and when he
saw one of the clay images in the vestibule staring at
him with its great glass<a id="Anchor-571" title="Go to Footnote 571" href="#Footnote-571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> eyes, the temptation was irresistible;
and, secretly gouging them out with his finger,
he carried them off with him. When they reached
home, his relative was taken suddenly ill and remained
for a long time speechless; at length, jumping up he
cried out several times in a voice of thunder, “Why did
you gouge out my eyes?” His family did not know
what to make of this, until little T‘ang told them what
he had done; they then immediately began to pray to
the possessed man, saying, “A mere child, unconscious
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-234"><a id="Page_ii-234"></a></span>
of the wickedness of his act, took away in his fun thy
sacred eyes. They shall be reverently replaced.” Thereupon
the voice exclaimed, “In that case, I shall go
away;” and he had hardly spoken before T‘ang’s relative
fell flat upon the ground and lay there in a state of insensibility
for some time. When he recovered, they
asked him concerning what he had said; but he remembered
nothing of it. The eyes were then forthwith
restored to their original sockets.</p>

THE INVISIBLE PRIEST.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Han</span> was a gentleman of good family, on very
intimate terms with a skilful Taoist priest and magician
named Tan, who, when sitting amongst other guests,
would suddenly become invisible. Mr. Han was extremely
anxious to learn this art, but Tan refused all his
entreaties, “Not,” as he said, “because I want to keep
the secret for myself, but simply as a matter of principle.
To teach the superior man<a id="Anchor-572" title="Go to Footnote 572" href="#Footnote-572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> would be well enough;
others, however, would avail themselves of such knowledge
to plunder their neighbours. There is no fear that
you would do this, though even you might be tempted
in certain ways.” Mr. Han, finding all his efforts unavailing,
flew into a great passion, and secretly arranged
with his servants that they should give the magician a
sound beating; and, in order to prevent his escape
through the power of making himself invisible, he had
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-236"><a id="Page_ii-236"></a></span>
his threshing-floor<a id="Anchor-573" title="Go to Footnote 573" href="#Footnote-573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> covered with a fine ash-dust, so that
at any rate his footsteps would be seen and the servants
could strike just above them.<a id="Anchor-574" title="Go to Footnote 574" href="#Footnote-574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> He then inveigled Tan
to the appointed spot, which he had no sooner reached
than Han’s servants began to belabour him on all sides
with leathern thongs. Tan immediately became invisible,
but his footprints were clearly seen as he moved
about hither and thither to avoid the blows, and the
servants went on striking above them until finally he
succeeded in getting away. Mr. Han then went home,
and subsequently Tan reappeared and told the servants
that he could stay there no longer, adding that before he
went he intended to give them all a feast in return for
many things they had done for him. And diving into
his sleeve he brought forth a quantity of delicious meats
and wines which he spread out upon the table, begging
them to sit down and enjoy themselves. The servants
did so, and one and all of them got drunk and insensible;
upon which Tan picked each of them up and stowed
them away in his sleeve. When Mr. Han heard of this,
he begged Tan to perform some other trick; so Tan
drew upon the wall a city, and knocking at the gate with
his hand it was instantly thrown open. He then put inside
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-237"><a id="Page_ii-237"></a></span>
it his wallet and clothes, and stepping through the
gateway himself, waved his hand and bade Mr. Han
farewell. The city gates were now closed, and Tan
vanished from their sight. It was said that he appeared
again in Ch‘ing-chou, where he taught little boys to paint
a circle on their hands, and, by dabbing this on to
another person’s face or clothes, to imprint the circle on
the place thus struck without a trace of it being left
behind upon the hand.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Just</span> beyond Fêng-tu<a id="Anchor-575" title="Go to Footnote 575" href="#Footnote-575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> there is a fathomless cave
which is reputed to be the entrance to Purgatory. All
the implements of torture employed therein are of
human manufacture; old, worn-out gyves and fetters
being occasionally found at the mouth of the cave, and
as regularly replaced by new ones, which disappear the
same night, and for which the magistrate of the district
makes a formal charge<a id="Anchor-576" title="Go to Footnote 576" href="#Footnote-576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> in his accounts.</p>

<p>Under the Ming dynasty, there was a certain Censor,<a id="Anchor-577" title="Go to Footnote 577" href="#Footnote-577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-239"><a id="Page_ii-239"></a></span>
named Hua, whose duties brought him to this place;
and hearing the story of the cave, he said he did not
believe it, but would penetrate into it and see for himself.
People tried to dissuade him from such an enterprise;
however, he paid no heed to their remonstrances, and
entered the cave with a lighted candle in his hand,
followed by two attendants. They had proceeded about
half a mile, when suddenly the candle was violently extinguished,
and Mr. Hua saw before him a broad flight
of steps leading up to the Ten Courts, or Judgment-halls,
in each of which a judge was sitting with his robes and
tablets all complete. On the eastern side there was one
vacant place; and when the judges saw Mr. Hua, they
hastened down the steps to meet him, and each one
cried out, “So you have come at last, have you? I hope
you have been quite well since last we met.” Mr. Hua
asked what the place was; to which they replied that it
was the Court of Purgatory, and then Mr. Hua in a
great fright was about to take his leave, when the judges
stopped him, saying, “No, no, Sir! that is your seat
there; how can you imagine you are to go back again?”
Thereupon Mr. Hua was overwhelmed with fear, and
begged and implored the judges to forgive him; but the
latter declared they could not interfere with the decrees
of fate, and taking down the register of Life and Death
they showed him that it had been ordained that on such
a day of such a month his living body would pass into
the realms of darkness. When Mr. Hua read these
words he shivered and shook as if iced water was being
poured down his back, and thinking of his old mother
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-240"><a id="Page_ii-240"></a></span>
and his young children, his tears began to flow. At that
juncture an angel in golden armour appeared, holding in
his hand a document written on yellow silk,<a id="Anchor-578" title="Go to Footnote 578" href="#Footnote-578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> before
which the judges all performed a respectful obeisance.
They then unfolded and read the document, which was
nothing more or less than a general pardon from the
Almighty for the suffering sinners in Purgatory, by virtue
of which Mr. Hua’s fate would be set aside, and he
would be enabled to return once more to the light of
day. Thereupon the judges congratulated him upon his
release, and started him on his way home; but he had
not got more than a few steps of the way before he
found himself plunged in total darkness. He was just
beginning to despair, when forth from the gloom came a
God with a red face and a long beard, rays of light shooting
out from his body and illuminating the darkness
around. Mr. Hua made up to him at once, and begged
to know how he could get out of the cave; to which the
God curtly replied, “Repeat the <i>sûtras</i> of Buddha!”
and vanished instantly from his sight. Now Mr. Hua
had forgotten almost all the <i>sûtras</i> he had ever known;
however, he remembered a little of the diamond <i>sûtra</i>,
and, clasping his hands in an attitude of prayer, he began
to repeat it aloud. No sooner had he done this than a
faint streak of light glimmered through the darkness,
and revealed to him the direction of the path; but the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-241"><a id="Page_ii-241"></a></span>
next moment he was at a loss how to go on and the light
forthwith disappeared. He then set himself to think
hard what the next verse was, and as fast as he recollected
and could go on repeating, so fast did the light
reappear to guide him on his way, until at length he
emerged once more from the mouth of the cave. As to
the fate of the two servants who accompanied him it is
needless to inquire.</p>

MR. WILLOW AND THE LOCUSTS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">During</span> the Ming dynasty a plague of locusts<a id="Anchor-579" title="Go to Footnote 579" href="#Footnote-579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> visited
Ch‘ing-yen, and was advancing rapidly towards the I
district, when the magistrate of that place, in great
tribulation at the pending disaster, retired one day to
sleep behind the screen in his office. There he dreamt
that a young graduate, named Willow, wearing a tall
hat and a green robe, and of very commanding stature,
came to see him, and declared that he could tell the
magistrate how to get rid of the locusts. “To-morrow,”
said he, “on the south-west road, you will see a woman
riding<a id="Anchor-580" title="Go to Footnote 580" href="#Footnote-580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> on a large jennet: she is the Spirit of the
Locusts; ask her, and she will help you.” The magistrate
thought this strange advice; however, he got
everything ready, and waited, as he had been told, at
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-243"><a id="Page_ii-243"></a></span>
the roadside. By-and-by, along came a woman with
her hair tied up in a knot, and a serge cape over her
shoulders, riding slowly northwards on an old mule;
whereupon the magistrate burned some sticks of incense,
and, seizing the mule’s bridle, humbly presented
a goblet of wine. The woman asked him what he
wanted; to which he replied, “Lady, I implore you
to save my small magistracy from the dreadful ravages
of your locusts.” “Oho!” said the woman, “that
scoundrel, Willow, has been letting the cat out of the
bag, has he? He shall suffer for it: I won’t touch your
crops.” She then drank three cups of wine, and
vanished out of sight. Subsequently, when the locusts
did come, they flew high in the air, and did not settle
on the crops; but they stripped the leaves off every
willow-tree far and wide; and then the magistrate
awaked to the fact that the graduate of his dream was
the Spirit of the Willows. Some said that this happy
result was owing to the magistrate’s care for the welfare
of his people.</p>

MR. TUNG; OR, VIRTUE REWARDED.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Ch‘ing-chow there lived a Mr. Tung, President
of one of the Six Boards, whose domestic regulations
were so strict that the men and women servants were
not allowed to speak to each other.<a id="Anchor-581" title="Go to Footnote 581" href="#Footnote-581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> One day he
caught a slave-girl laughing and talking with one of his
attendants, and gave them both a sound rating. That
night he retired to sleep, accompanied by his <i xml:lang="fr">valet-de-chambre</i>,
in his library, the door of which, as it was very
hot weather, was left wide open. When the night was
far advanced, the valet was awaked by a noise at his
master’s bed: and, opening his eyes, he saw, by the
light of the moon, the attendant above-mentioned pass
out of the door with something in his hand. Recognizing
the man as one of the family, he thought
nothing of the occurrence, but turned round and went
to sleep again. Soon after, however, he was again
aroused by the noise of footsteps tramping heavily
across the room, and, looking up, he beheld a huge
being with a red face and a long beard, very like the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-245"><a id="Page_ii-245"></a></span>
God of War,<a id="Anchor-582" title="Go to Footnote 582" href="#Footnote-582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> carrying a man’s head. Horribly
frightened, he crawled under the bed, and then he
heard sounds above him as of clothes being shaken out,
and as if some one was being shampooed.<a id="Anchor-583" title="Go to Footnote 583" href="#Footnote-583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> In a few
moments, the boots tramped once more across the room
and went away; and then he gradually put out his
head, and, seeing the dawn beginning to peep through
the window, he stretched out his hand to reach his
clothes. These he found to be soaked through and
through, and, on applying his hand to his nose, he
smelt the smell of blood. He now called out loudly to
his master, who jumped up at once; and, by the light
of a candle, they saw that the bed clothes and pillows
were alike steeped in blood. Just then some constables
knocked at the door, and when Mr. Tung went out to
see who it was, the constables were all astonishment;
“for,” said they, “a few minutes ago a man rushed
wildly up to our yamên, and said he had killed his
master; and, as he himself was covered with blood, he
was arrested, and turned out to be a servant of yours.
He also declared that he had buried your head alongside
the temple of the God of War; and when we went
to look, there, indeed, was a freshly-dug hole, but the
head was gone.” Mr. Tung was amazed at all this
story, and, on proceeding to the magistrate’s yamên, he
discovered that the man in charge was the attendant
whom he had scolded the day before. Thereupon, the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-246"><a id="Page_ii-246"></a></span>
criminal was severely bambooed and released; and then
Mr. Tung, who was unwilling to make an enemy of a
man of this stamp, gave him the girl to wife. However,
a few nights afterwards the people who lived next door
to the newly-married couple heard a terrific crash in
their house, and, rushing in to see what was the matter,
found that husband and wife, and the bedstead as well,
had been cut clean in two as if by a sword. The ways
of the God are many, indeed, but few more extraordinary
than this.<a id="Anchor-584" title="Go to Footnote 584" href="#Footnote-584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

THE DEAD PRIEST.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> Taoist priest, overtaken in his wanderings
by the shades of evening, sought refuge in a small
Buddhist monastery. The monk’s apartment was, however,
locked; so he threw his mat down in the vestibule
of the shrine, and seated himself upon it. In the
middle of the night, when all was still, he heard a
sound of some one opening the door behind him; and
looking round, he saw a Buddhist priest, covered with
blood from head to foot, who did not seem to notice
that anybody else was present. Accordingly, he himself
pretended not to be aware of what was going on; and
then he saw the other priest enter the shrine, mount
the altar, and remain there some time embracing
Buddha’s head, and laughing by turns. When morning
came, he found the monk’s room still locked; and,
suspecting something was wrong, he walked to a neighbouring
village, where he told the people what he had
seen. Thereupon the villagers went back with him, and
broke open the door, and there before them lay the
priest weltering in his blood, having evidently been
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-248"><a id="Page_ii-248"></a></span>
killed by robbers, who had stripped the place bare.
Anxious now to find out what had made the disembodied
spirit of the priest laugh in the way it had been
seen to do, they proceeded to inspect the head of the
Buddha on the altar; and, at the back of it, they
noticed a small mark, scraping through which they discovered
a sum of over thirty ounces of silver. This
sum was forthwith used for defraying the funeral expenses
of the murdered man.</p>

THE FLYING COW.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> man, who had bought a fine cow, dreamt
the same night that wings grew out of the animal’s
back, and that it had flown away. Regarding this as
an omen of some pending misfortune, he led the cow
off to market again, and sold it at a ruinous loss.
Wrapping up in a cloth the silver he received, he
slung it over his back, and was half way home, when
he saw a falcon eating part of a hare.<a id="Anchor-585" title="Go to Footnote 585" href="#Footnote-585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> Approaching
the bird, he found it was quite tame, and accordingly
tied it by the leg to one of the corners of the cloth,
in which his money was. The falcon fluttered about
a good deal, trying to escape; and, by-and-by, the

<br/>
THE “MIRROR AND LISTEN” TRICK.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> I-tu there lived a family of the name of Chêng.
The two sons were both distinguished scholars, but the
elder was early known to fame, and, consequently, the
favourite with his parents, who also extended their
preference to his wife. The younger brother was a
trifle wild, which displeased his father and mother very
much, and made them regard his wife, too, with anything
but a friendly eye. The latter reproached her
husband for being the cause of this, and asked him
why he, being a man like his brother, could not vindicate
the slights that were put upon her. This piqued
him; and, setting to work in good earnest, he soon
gained a fair reputation, though still not equal to his
brother’s. That year the two went up for the highest
degree; and, on New Year’s Eve, the wife of the
younger, very anxious for the success of her husband,
secretly tried the “mirror and listen” trick.<a id="Anchor-588" title="Go to Footnote 588" href="#Footnote-588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> She saw
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-252"><a id="Page_ii-252"></a></span>
two men pushing each other in jest, and heard them say,
“You go and get cool,” which remark she was quite
unable to interpret for good or for bad, so she thought
no more about the matter. After the examination, the
two brothers returned home; and one day, when the
weather was extremely hot, and their two wives were
hard at work in the cook-house, preparing food for
their field-labourers, a messenger rode up in hot haste<a id="Anchor-589" title="Go to Footnote 589" href="#Footnote-589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>
to announce that the elder brother had passed. Thereupon
his mother went into the cook-house, and, calling
to her daughter-in-law, said, “Your husband has passed;
<em>you go and get cool</em>.” Rage and grief now filled the
breast of the second son’s wife, who, with tears in her
eyes, continued her task of cooking, when suddenly
another messenger rushed in to say, that the second
son had passed, too. At this, his wife flung down her
frying-pan, and cried out, “Now I’ll <em>go and get cool;</em>”
and as in the heat of her excitement she uttered these
words, the recollection of her trial of the “mirror and
listen” trick flashed upon her, and she knew that the
words of that evening had been fulfilled.</p>

THE CATTLE PLAGUE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Ch‘ên Hua-fêng</span>, of Mêng-shan, overpowered by
the great heat, went and lay down under a tree, when
suddenly up came a man with a thick comforter round
his neck, who also sat down on a stone in the shade,
and began fanning himself as hard as he could, the
perspiration all the time running off him like a waterfall.
Ch‘ên rose and said to him with a smile, “If
Sir, you were to remove that comforter, you would be
cool enough without the help of a fan.” “It would be
easy enough,” replied the stranger, “to take off my
comforter; but the difficulty would be in getting it on
again.” He then went on to converse generally upon
other matters, in a manner which betokened considerable
refinement; and by-and-by he exclaimed, “What I
should like now is just a draught of iced wine to cool
the twelve joints of my œsophagus.”<a id="Anchor-590" title="Go to Footnote 590" href="#Footnote-590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> “Come along,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-254"><a id="Page_ii-254"></a></span>
then,” cried Ch‘ên, “my house is close by, and I shall
be happy to give you what you want.” So off they
went together; and Ch‘ên set before them some capital
wine, which he produced from a cave, cold enough to
numb their teeth. The stranger was delighted, and
remained there drinking until late in the evening,
when, all at once, it began to rain. Ch‘ên lighted a
lamp; and he and his guest, who now took off the
comforter, sat talking together in <i xml:lang="fr">dishabille</i>. Every
now and again the former thought he saw a light
coming from the back of the stranger’s head; and
when at length he had gone off into a tipsy sleep,
Ch‘ên took the light to examine more closely. He
found behind the ears a large cavity, partitioned by a
number of membranes, and looking like a lattice, with
a thin skin hanging down in front of each, the spaces
being apparently empty. In great astonishment Ch‘ên
took a hair-pin, and inserted it into one of these
places, when pff! out flew something like a tiny cow,
which broke through the window,<a id="Anchor-591" title="Go to Footnote 591" href="#Footnote-591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> and was gone. This
frightened <a id="tn_20">Ch‘ên</a>, and he determined to play no more
tricks; just then, however, the stranger waked up.
“Alas!” cried he, “you have been at my head, and
have let out the Cattle Plague. What is to be done,
now?” Ch‘ên asked what he meant: upon which the
stranger said, “There is no object in further concealment.
I will tell you all. I am the Angel of Pestilence
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-255"><a id="Page_ii-255"></a></span>
for the six kinds of domestic animals. That form
which you have let out attacks oxen, and I fear that,
for miles round, few will escape alive.” Now <a id="tn_21">Ch‘ên</a>
himself was a cattle-farmer, and when he heard this
was dreadfully alarmed, and implored the stranger to
tell him what to do. “What to do!” replied he; “why,
I shall not escape punishment myself; how can I tell
you what to do. However, you will find powdered
<i>K‘u-ts‘an</i><a id="Anchor-592" title="Go to Footnote 592" href="#Footnote-592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> an efficacious remedy, that is if you don’t
keep it a secret for your private use.”<a id="Anchor-593" title="Go to Footnote 593" href="#Footnote-593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> The stranger
then departed, first of all piling up a quantity of earth
in a niche in the wall, a handful of which, he told
Ch‘ên, given to each animal, might prove of some
avail. Before long the plague did break out; and
Ch‘ên, who was desirous of making a little money by
it, told the remedy to no one, with the exception of
his younger brother. The latter tried it on his own
beasts with great success; while, on the other hand,
those belonging to Ch‘ên himself died off, to the
number of fifty head,<a id="Anchor-594" title="Go to Footnote 594" href="#Footnote-594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> leaving him only four or five old
cows, which shewed every sign of soon sharing the
same fate. In his distress, Ch‘ên suddenly bethought
himself of the earth in the niche; and, as a last
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-256"><a id="Page_ii-256"></a></span>
resource, gave some to the sick animals. By the next
morning they were quite well, and then he knew that
his secrecy about the remedy had caused it to have no
effect. From that moment his stock went on increasing,
and in a few years he had as many as ever.</p>

THE MARRIAGE OF THE VIRGIN
GODDESS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Kuei-chi there is a shrine to the Plum Virgin, who
was formerly a young lady named Ma, and lived at
Tung-wan. Her betrothed husband dying before the
wedding, she swore she would never marry, and at thirty
years of age she died. Her kinsfolk built a shrine to
her memory, and gave her the title of the Plum Virgin.
Some years afterwards, a Mr. Chin, on his way to the
examination, happened to pass by the shrine; and
entering in, he walked up and down thinking very much
of the young lady in whose honour it had been erected.
That night he dreamt that a servant came to summon
him into the presence of the Goddess; and that, in
obedience to her command, he went and found her
waiting for him just outside the shrine. “I am deeply
grateful to you, Sir,” said the Goddess, on his approach,
“for giving me so large a share of your thoughts; and
I intend to repay you by becoming your humble handmaid.”
Mr. Chin bowed an assent; and then the
Goddess escorted him back, saying, “When your place
is ready, I will come and fetch you.” On waking in the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-258"><a id="Page_ii-258"></a></span>
morning, Mr. Chin was not over pleased with his dream;
however that very night every one of the villagers dreamt
that the Goddess appeared and said she was going to
marry Mr. Chin, bidding them at once prepare an image
of him. This the village elders, out of respect for their
Goddess, positively refused to do; until at length they
all began to fall ill, and then they made a clay image of
Mr. Chin, and placed it on the left of the Goddess.
Mr. Chin now told his wife that the Plum Virgin had
come for him; and, putting on his official cap and robes,
he straightway died. Thereupon his wife was very
angry; and, going to the shrine, she first abused the
Goddess, and then, getting on the altar, slapped her
face well. The Goddess is now called Chin’s virgin
wife.</p>

THE WINE INSECT.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A Mr. Lin</span> of Ch‘ang-shan was extremely fat, and
so fond of wine<a id="Anchor-595" title="Go to Footnote 595" href="#Footnote-595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> that he would often finish a pitcher
by himself. However, he owned about fifty acres of
land, half of which was covered with millet, and being
well off, he did not consider that his drinking would
bring him into trouble. One day a foreign Buddhist
priest saw him, and remarked that he appeared to be
suffering from some extraordinary complaint. Mr. Lin
said nothing was the matter with him; whereupon the
priest asked him if he often got drunk. Lin acknowledged
that he did; and the priest told him that he was
afflicted by the wine insect. “Dear me!” cried Lin, in
great alarm, “do you think you could cure me?” The
priest declared there would be no difficulty in doing so;
but when Lin asked him what drugs he intended to
use, the priest said he should not use any at all. He
then made Lin lie down in the sun; and tying his hands
and feet together, he placed a stoup of good wine about
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-260"><a id="Page_ii-260"></a></span>
half a foot from his head. By-and-by, Lin felt a deadly
thirst coming on; and the flavour of the wine passing
through his nostrils, seemed to set his vitals on fire.
Just then he experienced a tickling sensation in his
throat, and something ran out of his mouth and jumped
into the wine. On being released from his bonds, he
saw that it was an insect about three inches in length,
which wriggled about in the wine like a tadpole, and
had mouth and eyes all complete. Lin was overjoyed,
and offered money to the priest, who refused to take
it, saying, all he wanted was the insect, which he
explained to Lin was the essence of wine, and which,
on being stirred up in water, would turn it into wine.
Lin tried this, and found it was so; and ever afterwards
he detested the sight of wine. He subsequently became
very thin, and so poor that he had hardly enough to eat
and drink.<a id="Anchor-596" title="Go to Footnote 596" href="#Footnote-596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

door,<a id="Anchor-597" title="Go to Footnote 597" href="#Footnote-597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> scraped together one hundred ounces of silver,
and set out for the city to try and arrange for his parent’s
release. Jumping on a mule, he saw that a black dog,
belonging to the family, was following him. He tried
in vain to make the dog remain at home; and when,
after travelling for some miles, he got off his mule to
rest awhile, he picked up a large stone and threw it at
the dog, which then ran off. However, he was no
sooner on the road again, than up came the dog, and
tried to stop the mule by holding on to its tail. His
master beat it off with the whip; whereupon the dog
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-262"><a id="Page_ii-262"></a></span>
ran barking loudly in front of the mule, and seemed
to be using every means in its power to cause his
master to stop. The latter thought this a very inauspicious
omen, and turning upon the animal in a
rage, drove it away out of sight. He now went on
to the city; but when, in the dusk of the evening,
he arrived there, he found that about half his money
was gone. In a terrible state of mind he tossed about
all night; then, all of a sudden, it flashed across him
that the strange behaviour of the dog might possibly
have some meaning; so getting up very early, he left
the city as soon as the gates were open,<a id="Anchor-598" title="Go to Footnote 598" href="#Footnote-598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> and though,
from the number of passers-by, he never expected to find
his money again, he went on until he reached the spot
where he had got off his mule the day before. There
he saw his dog lying dead upon the ground, its hair
having apparently been wetted through with perspiration;<a id="Anchor-599" title="Go to Footnote 599" href="#Footnote-599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>
and, lifting up the body by one of its ears, he
found his lost silver. Full of gratitude, he bought
a coffin and buried the dead animal; and the people
now call the place the Grave of the Faithful Dog.</p>

AN EARTHQUAKE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">In</span> 1668 there was a very severe earthquake.<a id="Anchor-600" title="Go to Footnote 600" href="#Footnote-600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> I
myself was staying at Chi-hsia, and happened to be
that night sitting over a kettle of wine with my cousin
Li Tu. All of a sudden we heard a noise like thunder,
travelling from the south-east in a north-westerly
direction. We were much astonished at this, and
quite unable to account for the noise; in another
moment the table began to rock, and the wine-cups
were upset; the beams and supports of the house
snapped here and there with a crash, and we looked
at each other in fear and trembling. By-and-by we
knew that it was an earthquake; and, rushing out, we
saw houses and other buildings, as it were, fall down and
get up again; and, amidst the sounds of crushing
walls, we heard the shrieks of women and children,
the whole mass being like a great seething cauldron.
Men were giddy and could not stand, but rolled
about on the ground; the river overflowed its banks;
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-264"><a id="Page_ii-264"></a></span>
cocks crowed, and dogs barked from one end of the
city to the other. In a little while the quaking began
to subside; and then might be seen men and women
running half naked about the streets, all anxious to
tell their own experiences, and forgetting that they
had on little or no clothing. I subsequently heard
that a well was closed up and rendered useless by this
earthquake; that a house was turned completely round,
so as to face the opposite direction; that the Chi-hsia
hill was riven open, and that the waters of the I river
flowed in and made a lake of an acre and more. Truly
such an earthquake as this is of rare occurrence.</p>

MAKING ANIMALS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">The</span> tricks for bewitching people are many. Sometimes
drugs are put in their food, and when they eat
they become dazed, and follow the person who has
bewitched them. This is commonly called <i>ta hsü pa;</i>
in Kiang-nan it is known as <i>ch‘ê hsü</i>. Little children
are most frequently bewitched in this way. There is
also what is called “making animals,” which is better
known on the south side of the River.<a id="Anchor-601" title="Go to Footnote 601" href="#Footnote-601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>One day a man arrived at an inn in Yang-chow,
leading with him five donkeys. Tying them up near
the stable, he told the landlord he would be back in a
few minutes, and bade him give his donkeys no water.
He had not been gone long before the donkeys, which
were standing out in the glare of the sun, began to kick
about, and make a noise; whereupon the landlord
untied them, and was going to put them in the shade,
when suddenly they espied water, and made a rush to
get at it. So the landlord let them drink; and no
sooner had the water touched their lips than they rolled
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-266"><a id="Page_ii-266"></a></span>
on the ground, and changed into women. In great
astonishment, the landlord asked them whence they
came; but their tongues were tied, and they could not
answer, so he hid them in his private apartments, and
at that moment their owner returned, bringing with him
five sheep. The latter immediately asked the landlord
where his donkeys were; to which the landlord replied
by offering him some wine, saying, the donkeys would
be brought to him directly. He then went out and
gave the sheep some water, on drinking which they were
all changed into boys. Accordingly, he communicated
with the authorities, and the stranger was arrested and
forthwith beheaded.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> magistrate caused a petty oil-vendor, who
was brought before him for some trifling misdemeanour,
and whose statements were very confused, to be bambooed
to death. The former subsequently rose to high
rank; and having amassed considerable wealth, set
about building himself a fine house. On the day when
the great beam was to be fixed in its place,<a id="Anchor-602" title="Go to Footnote 602" href="#Footnote-602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> among the
friends and relatives who arrived to offer their congratulations,
he was horrified to see the oilman walk in.
At the same instant one of the servants came rushing
up to announce to him the birth of a son; whereupon,
he mournfully remarked, “The house not yet finished,
and its destroyer already here.” The bystanders thought
he was joking, for they had not seen what he had seen.<a id="Anchor-603" title="Go to Footnote 603" href="#Footnote-603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>
However, when that boy grew up, by his frivolity and

obliged himself to go into service; and spent all his
earnings in oil, which he swallowed in large quantities.</p>

THE WEI-CH‘I DEVIL.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> general, who had resigned his command,
and had retired to his own home, was very fond of
roaming about and amusing himself with wine and
<i>wei-ch‘i</i>.<a id="Anchor-604" title="Go to Footnote 604" href="#Footnote-604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> One day&mdash;it was the 9th of the 9th moon,
when everybody goes up high<a id="Anchor-605" title="Go to Footnote 605" href="#Footnote-605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>&mdash;as he was playing
with some friends, a stranger walked up, and watched
the game intently for some time without going away.
He was a miserable-looking creature, with a very ragged
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-269"><a id="Page_ii-269"></a></span>
coat, but nevertheless possessed of a refined and
courteous air. The general begged him to be seated,
an offer which he accepted, being all the time extremely
deferential in his manner. “I suppose you are pretty
good at this,” said the general, pointing to the board;
“try a bout with one of my friends here.” The stranger
made a great many apologies in reply, but finally accepted,
and played a game in which, apparently to his
great disappointment, he was beaten. He played
another with the same result; and now, refusing all
offers of wine, he seemed to think of nothing but how
to get some one to play with him. Thus he went on
until the afternoon was well advanced; when suddenly,
just as he was in the middle of a most exciting game,
which depended on a single place, he rushed forward,
and throwing himself at the feet of the general, loudly
implored his protection. The general did not know
what to make of this; however, he raised him up, and
said, “It’s only a game: why get so excited?” To this
the stranger replied by begging the general not to let
his gardener seize him; and when the general asked
what gardener he meant, he said the man’s name was
Ma-ch‘êng. Now this Ma-ch‘êng was often employed
as a lictor by the Ruler of Purgatory, and would sometimes
remain away as much as ten days, serving the
warrants of death; accordingly, the general sent off to
inquire about him, and found that he had been in a
trance for two days.<a id="Anchor-606" title="Go to Footnote 606" href="#Footnote-606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> His master cried out that he had
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-270"><a id="Page_ii-270"></a></span>
better not behave rudely to his guest, but at that very
moment the stranger sunk down to the ground, and was
gone. The general was lost in astonishment; however,
he now knew that the man was a disembodied spirit, and
on the next day, when Ma-ch‘êng came round, he asked
him for full particulars. “The gentleman was a native
of Hu-hsiang,” replied the gardener, “who was passionately
addicted to <i>wei-ch‘i</i>, and had lost a great deal
of money by it. His father, being much grieved at
his behaviour, confined him to the house; but he was
always getting out, and indulging the fatal passion, and
at last his father died of a broken heart. In consequence
of this, the Ruler of Purgatory curtailed
his term of life, and condemned him to become a
hungry devil,<a id="Anchor-607" title="Go to Footnote 607" href="#Footnote-607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> in which state he has already passed
seven years. And now that the Phœnix Tower<a id="Anchor-608" title="Go to Footnote 608" href="#Footnote-608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> is completed,
an order has been issued for the literati to present
themselves, and compose an inscription to be cut
on stone, as a memorial thereof, by which means they
would secure their own salvation as a reward. Many
of the shades failing to arrive at the appointed time,
God was very angry with the Ruler of Purgatory, and
the latter sent off me, and others who are employed
in the same way, to hunt up the defaulters. But as you,
Sir, bade me treat the gentleman with respect, I did not
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-271"><a id="Page_ii-271"></a></span>
venture to bind him.” The general inquired what had
become of the stranger; to which the gardener replied,
“He is now a mere menial in Purgatory, and can never
be born again.” “Alas!” cried his master, “thus it is
that men are ruined by any inordinate passion.”<a id="Anchor-609" title="Go to Footnote 609" href="#Footnote-609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a></p>

He did the same with another uncle, and thus united

fell ill, and seemed to go out of his mind; for he cried
out, “So you wish to live in wealth, do you?” and
immediately seizing a sharp knife, he began hacking
away at his own body until he had strewed the floor with
pieces of flesh. He then exclaimed, “You cut off other
people’s posterity and expect to have posterity yourself,
do you?” and forthwith he ripped himself open and
died. Shortly afterwards his son, too, died, and the property
fell into the hands of strangers. Is not this a

LIFE PROLONGED.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> cloth merchant of Ch‘ang-ch‘ing was
stopping at T‘ai-ngan, when he heard of a magician
who was said to be very skilled in casting nativities. So
he went off at once to consult him; but the magician
would not undertake the task, saying, “Your destiny is
bad: you had better hurry home.” At this the merchant
was dreadfully frightened, and, packing up his wares,
set off towards Ch‘ang-ch‘ing. On the way he fell in
with a man in short clothes,<a id="Anchor-612" title="Go to Footnote 612" href="#Footnote-612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> like a constable; and the
two soon struck up a friendly intimacy, taking their
meals together. By-and-by the merchant asked the
stranger what his business was; and the latter told him
he was going to Ch‘ang-ch‘ing to serve summonses, producing
at the same time a document and showing it to
the merchant, who, on looking closely, saw a list of
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-274"><a id="Page_ii-274"></a></span>
names, at the head of which was his own. In great
astonishment he inquired what he had done that he
should be arrested thus; to which his companion replied,
“I am not a living being: I am a lictor in the
employ of the infernal authorities, and I presume your
term of life has expired.” The merchant burst into
tears and implored the lictor to spare him, which the
latter declared was impossible; “But,” added he, “there
are a great many names down, and it will take me some
time to get through them: you go off home and settle up
your affairs, and, as a slight return for your friendship,
I’ll call for you last.” A few minutes afterwards they
reached a stream where the bridge was in ruins, and
people could only cross with great difficulty; at which
the lictor remarked, “You are now on the road to death,
and not a single cash can you carry away with you.
Repair this bridge and benefit the public; and thus from
a great outlay you may possibly yourself derive some
small advantage.” The merchant said he would do so;
and when he got home, he bade his wife and children
prepare for his coming dissolution, and at the same time
set men to work and made the bridge sound and strong
again. Some time elapsed, but no lictor arrived; and
his suspicions began to be aroused, when one day the
latter walked in and said, “I reported that affair of the
bridge to the Municipal God,<a id="Anchor-613" title="Go to Footnote 613" href="#Footnote-613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> who communicated it to
the Ruler of Purgatory; and for that good act your
span of life has been lengthened, and your name struck
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-275"><a id="Page_ii-275"></a></span>
out of the list. I have now come to announce this to
you.” The merchant was profuse in his thanks; and
the next time he went to T‘ai-ngan, he burnt a quantity
of paper ingots,<a id="Anchor-614" title="Go to Footnote 614" href="#Footnote-614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> and made offerings and libations to the
lictor, out of gratitude for what he had done. Suddenly
the lictor himself appeared, and cried out, “Do you wish
to ruin me? Happily my new master has only just taken
up his post, and he has not noticed this, or where should
I be?”<a id="Anchor-615" title="Go to Footnote 615" href="#Footnote-615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> The lictor then escorted the merchant some
distance; and, at parting, bade him never return by that
road, but, if he had any business at T‘ai-ngan, to go
thither by a roundabout way.</p>

THE CLAY IMAGE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">On</span> the river I there lived a man named Ma, who
married a wife from the Wang family, with whom he was
very happy in his domestic life. Ma, however, died
young; and his wife’s parents were unwilling that their
daughter should remain a widow, but she resisted all
their importunities, and declared firmly she would never
marry again. “It is a noble resolve of yours, I allow,”
argued her mother; “but you are still a mere girl, and
you have no children. Besides, I notice that people
who start with such rigid determinations always end by
doing something discreditable, and therefore you had
better get married as soon as you can, which is no more
than is done every day.” The girl swore she would
rather die than consent, and accordingly her mother had
no alternative but to let her alone. She then ordered a
clay image to be made, exactly resembling her late husband;<a id="Anchor-616" title="Go to Footnote 616" href="#Footnote-616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>
and whenever she took her own meals, she
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-277"><a id="Page_ii-277"></a></span>
would set meat and wine before it, precisely as if her
husband had been there. One night she was on the
point of retiring to rest, when suddenly she saw the clay
image stretch itself and step down from the table, increasing
all the while in height, until it was as tall as a
man, and neither more nor less than her own husband.
In great alarm she called out to her mother, but the
image stopped her, saying, “Don’t do that! I am but
shewing my gratitude for your affectionate care of me,
and it is chill and uncomfortable in the realms below.
Such devotion as yours casts its light back on generations
gone by; and now I, who was cut off in my
prime because my father did evil, and was condemned
to be without an heir, have been permitted, in consequence
of your virtuous conduct, to visit you once again,
that our ancestral line may yet remain unbroken.”<a id="Anchor-617" title="Go to Footnote 617" href="#Footnote-617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>
Every morning at cock-crow her husband resumed his
usual form and size as the clay image; and after a time
he told her that their hour of separation had come, upon
which husband and wife bade each other an eternal farewell.
By-and-by the widow, to the great astonishment of
her mother, bore a son, which caused no small amusement
among the neighbours who heard the story; and, as the
girl herself had no proof of what she stated to be the
case, a certain beadle<a id="Anchor-618" title="Go to Footnote 618" href="#Footnote-618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> of the place, who had an old
grudge against her husband, went off and informed the
magistrate of what had occurred. After some investigation,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-278"><a id="Page_ii-278"></a></span>
the magistrate exclaimed, “I have heard that the
children of disembodied spirits have no shadow; and
that those who have shadows are not genuine.” Thereupon
they took Ma’s child into the sunshine, and lo!
there was but a very faint shadow, like a thin vapour.
The magistrate then drew blood from the child, and
smeared it on the clay image; upon which the blood at
once soaked in and left no stain. Another clay image
being produced and the same experiment tried, the
blood remained on the surface so that it could be
wiped away.<a id="Anchor-619" title="Go to Footnote 619" href="#Footnote-619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> The girl’s story was thus acknowledged to
be true; and when the child grew up, and in every
feature was the counterpart of Ma, there was no longer
any room for suspicion.</p>

DISHONESTY PUNISHED.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Chiao-chou there lived a man named Liu Hsi-ch‘uan,
who was steward to His excellency Mr. Fa.
When already over forty a son was born to him, whom
he loved very dearly, and quite spoilt by always letting
him have his own way. When the boy grew up he led
a dissolute, extravagant life, and ran through all his
father’s property. By-and-by he fell sick, and then he
declared that nothing would cure him but a slice off a
fat old favourite mule they had; upon which his father
had another and more worthless animal killed; but his
son found out he was being tricked, and, after abusing
his father soundly, his symptoms became more and more
alarming. The mule was accordingly killed, and some
of it was served up to the sick man; however, he only
just tasted it and sent the rest away. From that time he
got gradually worse and worse, and finally died, to the
great grief of his father, who would gladly have died
too. Three or four years afterwards, as some of the
villagers were worshipping on Mount Tai, they saw a
man riding on a mule, the very image of Mr. Liu’s dead
son; and, on approaching more closely, they saw that it
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-280"><a id="Page_ii-280"></a></span>
was actually he.<a id="Anchor-620" title="Go to Footnote 620" href="#Footnote-620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> Jumping from his mule,<a id="Anchor-621" title="Go to Footnote 621" href="#Footnote-621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> he made
them a salutation, and then they began to chat with him
on various subjects, always carefully avoiding that one of
his own death. They asked him what he was doing
there; to which he replied that he was only roaming
about, and inquired of them in his turn at what inn they
were staying; “For,” added he, “I have an engagement
just now, but I will visit you to-morrow.” So they told
him the name of the inn, and took their leave, not expecting
to see him again. However, the next day he
came, and, tying his mule to a post outside, went in to
see them. “Your father,” observed one of the villagers,
“is always thinking about you. Why do you not go and
pay him a visit?” The young man asked to whom he
was alluding; and, at the mention of his father’s name,
he changed colour and said, “If he is anxious to see
me, kindly tell him that on the 7th of the 4th moon I
will await him here.” He then went away, and the
villagers returned and told Mr. Liu all that had taken
place. At the appointed time the latter was very desirous
of going to see his son; but his master dissuaded
him, saying that he thought from what he knew of his
son that the interview might possibly not turn out as he
would desire; “Although,” added he, “if you are bent
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-281"><a id="Page_ii-281"></a></span>
upon going, I should be sorry to stand in your way.
Let me, however, counsel you to conceal yourself in a
cupboard, and thus, by observing what takes place, you
will know better how to act, and avoid running into any
danger.” This he accordingly did, and, when his son
came, Mr. Fa received him at the inn as before.
“Where’s Mr. Liu?” cried the son. “Oh, he hasn’t
come,” replied Mr. Fa. “The old beast! What does
he mean by that?” exclaimed his son; whereupon Mr.
Fa asked him what <em>he</em> meant by cursing his own father.
“My father!” shrieked the son; “why he’s nothing
more to me than a former rascally partner in trade, who
cheated me out of all my money, and for which I have
since avenged myself on him.<a id="Anchor-622" title="Go to Footnote 622" href="#Footnote-622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> What sort of a father is
that, I should like to know?” He then went out of the
door; and his father crept out of the cupboard from
which, with the perspiration streaming down him and
hardly daring to breathe, he had heard all that had
passed, and sorrowfully wended his way home again.</p>

THE MAD PRIEST.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> mad priest, whose name I do not know,
lived in a temple on the hills. He would sing and cry
by turns, without any apparent reason; and once somebody
saw him boiling a stone for his dinner. At the
autumn festival of the 9th day of the 9th moon,<a id="Anchor-623" title="Go to Footnote 623" href="#Footnote-623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> an
official of the district went up in that direction for the
usual picnic, taking with him his chair and his red umbrellas.
After luncheon he was passing by the temple,
and had hardly reached the door, when out rushed the
priest, barefooted and ragged, and himself opening a
yellow umbrella, cried out as the attendants of a mandarin
do when ordering the people to stand back. He
then approached the official, and made as though he
were jesting at him; at which the latter was extremely
indignant, and bade his servants drive the priest away.
The priest moved off with the servants after him, and in
another moment had thrown down his yellow umbrella,
which split into a number of pieces, each piece changing
immediately into a falcon, and flying about in all directions.
The umbrella handle became a huge serpent,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-283"><a id="Page_ii-283"></a></span>
with red scales and glaring eyes; and then the party
would have turned and fled, but that one of them declared
it was only an optical delusion, and that the
creature couldn’t do any hurt. The speaker accordingly
seized a knife and rushed at the serpent, which forthwith
opened its mouth and swallowed its assailant whole. In
a terrible fright the servants crowded round their master
and hurried him away, not stopping to draw breath until
they were fully a mile off. By-and-by several of them
stealthily returned to see what was going on; and, on
entering the temple, they found that both priest and
serpent had disappeared. But from an old ash-tree hard
by they heard a sound proceeding,&mdash;a sound, as it were,
of a donkey panting; and at first they were afraid to go
near, though after a while they ventured to peep through
a hole in the tree, which was an old hollow trunk; and
there, jammed hard and fast with his head downwards,
was the rash assailant of the serpent. It being quite
impossible to drag him out, they began at once to cut
the tree away; but by the time they had set him free he
was already perfectly unconscious. However, he ultimately
came round and was carried home; but from
this day the priest was never seen again.<a id="Anchor-624" title="Go to Footnote 624" href="#Footnote-624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

this was a bad omen, and that she was not destined to
enjoy a long life; however, she said nothing on the
subject to her son, who was himself quite at a loss to
account for what had happened. A short time afterwards
the Literary Chancellor<a id="Anchor-626" title="Go to Footnote 626" href="#Footnote-626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> arrived; and young
Chao, scraping together what funds he could, went off
to present himself as a candidate. On the road he met
with a man who gave him such a cordial invitation to
his house that he willingly accepted; and the stranger
led him to a stately mansion, with towers and terraces
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-285"><a id="Page_ii-285"></a></span>
rising one above the other as far as the eye could reach.
In one of the apartments was a king, sitting upon a
throne, who received Shao in a very friendly manner;
and, after regaling him with an excellent banquet, said,
“I have to thank you for the food and drink you gave
my servants that day we passed your house.” Shao was
greatly astonished at this remark, when the King proceeded,
“I am the Ruler of Purgatory. Don’t you
recollect sacrificing on your mother’s birthday?” The
King then bestowed on Shao a packet of silver, saying,
“Pray accept this in return for your kindness.” Shao
thanked him and retired; and in another moment the
palace and its occupants had one and all vanished from
his sight, leaving him alone in the midst of some tall
trees. On opening his packet he found it to contain five
ounces of pure gold; and, after defraying the expenses
of his examination, half was still left, which he carried
home and gave to his mother.</p>

<br/>
THE PICTURE HORSE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> Mr. Ts‘ui, of Lin-ch‘ing, was too poor to
keep his garden walls in repair, and used often to find
a strange horse lying down on the grass inside. It was
a black horse marked with white, and having a scrubby
tail, which looked as if the end had been burnt off;<a id="Anchor-627" title="Go to Footnote 627" href="#Footnote-627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>
and, though always driven away, would still return to the
same spot. Now Mr. Ts‘ui had a friend, who was
holding an appointment in Shansi; and though he had
frequently felt desirous of paying him a visit, he had no
means of travelling so far. Accordingly, he one day
caught the strange horse and, putting a saddle on its
back, rode away, telling his <a id="tn_22">servant</a> that if the owner
of the horse should appear, he was to inform him where
the animal was to be found. The horse started off at a
very rapid pace, and, in a short time, they were thirty
or forty miles from home; but at night it did not seem
to care for its food, so the next day Mr. Ts‘ui, who
thought perhaps illness might be the cause, held the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-287"><a id="Page_ii-287"></a></span>
horse in, and would not let it gallop so fast. However,
the animal did not seem to approve of this, and
kicked and foamed until at length Mr. Ts‘ui let it go at
the same old pace; and by mid-day he had reached his
destination. As he rode into the town, the people
were astonished to hear of the marvellous journey just
accomplished, and the Prince<a id="Anchor-628" title="Go to Footnote 628" href="#Footnote-628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> sent to say he should
like to buy the horse. Mr. Ts‘ui, fearing that the real
owner might come forward, was compelled to refuse this
offer; but when, after six months had elapsed, no inquiries
had been made, he agreed to accept eight
hundred ounces of silver, and handed over the horse to
the Prince. He then bought himself a good mule, and
returned home. Subsequently, the Prince had occasion
to use the horse for some important business at Lin-ch‘ing;
and when there it took the opportunity to run
away. The officer in charge pursued it right up to the
house of a Mr. Tsêng, who lived next door to <a id="tn_23">Mr.
Ts‘ui</a>, and saw it run in and disappear. Thereupon he
called upon Mr. Tsêng to restore it to him; and, on
the latter declaring he had never even seen the animal,
the officer walked into his private apartments, where he
found, hanging on the wall, a picture of a horse, by
Tzŭ-ang,<a id="Anchor-629" title="Go to Footnote 629" href="#Footnote-629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> exactly like the one he was in search of, and
with part of the tail burnt away by a joss-stick. It
was now clear that the Prince’s horse was a supernatural
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-288"><a id="Page_ii-288"></a></span>
creature; but the officer, being afraid to go back
without it, would have prosecuted Mr. Tsêng, had not
Ts‘ui, whose eight hundred ounces of silver had since
increased to something like ten thousand, stepped in
and paid back the original purchase-money. Mr. Tsêng
was exceedingly grateful to him for this act of kindness,
ignorant, as he was, of the previous sale of the horse
by Ts‘ui to the Prince.</p>

THE BUTTERFLY’S REVENGE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Wang</span>, of Ch‘ang-shan, was in the habit, when a
District Magistrate, of commuting the fines and penalties
of the Penal Code, inflicted on the various prisoners, for
a corresponding number of butterflies. These he would
let go all at once in the court, rejoicing to see them
fluttering hither and thither, like so many tinsel snippings
borne about by the breeze. One night he dreamt
that a young lady, dressed in gay-coloured clothes,
appeared to him and said, “Your cruel practice has
brought many of my sisters to an untimely end, and
now you shall pay the penalty of thus gratifying your
tastes.” The young lady then changed into a butterfly
and flew away. Next day, the magistrate was sitting
alone, over a cup of wine, when it was announced to
him that the censor was at the door; and out he ran
at once to receive His Excellency, with a white flower,
that some of his women had put in his official hat, still
sticking there. His Excellency was very angry at what
he deemed a piece of disrespect to himself; and, after
severely censuring Mr. Wang, turned round and went
away. Thenceforward no more penalties were commuted
for butterflies.</p>

THE DOCTOR.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> poor man, named Chang, who lived at I,
fell in one day with a Taoist priest. The latter was
highly skilled in the science of physiognomy;<a id="Anchor-630" title="Go to Footnote 630" href="#Footnote-630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> and,
after looking at Chang’s features, said to him, “You
would make your fortune as a doctor.” “Alas!”
replied Chang, “I can barely read and write; how
then could I follow such a calling as that?” “And
where, you simple fellow,” asked the priest, “is the
necessity for a doctor to be a scholar? You just try,
that’s all.” Thereupon Chang returned home; and,
being very poor, he simply collected a few of the commonest
prescriptions, and set up a small stall with a
handful of fishes’ teeth and some dry honeycomb from
a wasp’s nest,<a id="Anchor-631" title="Go to Footnote 631" href="#Footnote-631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> hoping thus to earn, by his tongue,
enough to keep body and soul together, to which, however,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-291"><a id="Page_ii-291"></a></span>
no one paid any particular attention. Now it
chanced that just then the Governor of Ch‘ing-chou
was suffering from a bad cough, and had given orders
to his subordinates to send to him the most skilful
doctors in their respective districts; and the magistrate
of I, which was an out-of-the-way mountainous district,
being unable to lay his hands on any one whom he could
send in, gave orders to the beadle<a id="Anchor-632" title="Go to Footnote 632" href="#Footnote-632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> to do the best he
could under the circumstances. Accordingly, Chang
was nominated by the people, and the magistrate put
his name down to go in to the Governor. When Chang
heard of his appointment, he happened to be suffering
himself from a bad attack of bronchitis, which he was
quite unable to cure, and he begged, therefore, to be
excused; but the magistrate would not hear of this, and
forwarded him at once in charge of some constables.
While crossing the hills, he became very thirsty, and
went into a village to ask for a drink of water; but
water there was worth its weight in jade, and no one
would give him any. By-and-by he saw an old woman
washing a quantity of vegetables in a scanty supply of
water which was, consequently, very thick and muddy;
and, being unable to bear his thirst any longer, he
obtained this and drank it up. Shortly afterwards he
found that his cough was quite cured, and then it
occurred to him that he had hit upon a capital remedy.
When he reached the city, he learned that a great many
doctors had already tried their hand upon the patient,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-292"><a id="Page_ii-292"></a></span>
but without success; so asking for a private room in
which to prepare his medicines, he obtained from the
town some bunches of bishop-wort, and proceeded to
wash them as the old woman had done. He then took
the dirty water, and gave a dose of it to the Governor,
who was immediately and permanently relieved. The
patient was overjoyed; and, besides making Chang a
handsome present, gave him a certificate written in
golden characters, in consequence of which his fame
spread far and wide;<a id="Anchor-633" title="Go to Footnote 633" href="#Footnote-633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> and of the numerous cases he
subsequently undertook, in not a single instance did he
fail to effect a cure. One day, however, a patient came
to him, complaining of a violent chill; and Chang, who
happened to be tipsy at the time, treated him by mistake
for remittent fever. When he got sober, he became
aware of what he had done; but he said nothing to
anybody about it, and three days afterwards the same
patient waited upon him with all kinds of presents to
thank him for a rapid recovery. Such cases as this were
by no means rare with him; and soon he got so rich
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-293"><a id="Page_ii-293"></a></span>
that he would not attend when summoned to visit a sick
person, unless the summons was accompanied by a
heavy fee and a comfortable chair to ride in.<a id="Anchor-634" title="Go to Footnote 634" href="#Footnote-634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></p>

The people were in a great state of consternation at

pray. Then the spirit moved one of them to say, “You

PLANCHETTE.</a><a id="Anchor-638" title="Go to Footnote 638" href="#Footnote-638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Ch‘ang-shan there lived a man, named Wang
Jui-t‘ing, who understood the art of planchette. He
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-296"><a id="Page_ii-296"></a></span>
called himself a disciple of Lü Tung-pin,<a id="Anchor-639" title="Go to Footnote 639" href="#Footnote-639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> and some one
said he was probably that worthy’s crane. At his <i>séances</i>
the subjects were always literary&mdash;essays, poetry, and so
on. The well-known scholar, Li Chih, thought very
highly of him, and availed himself of his aid on more
than one occasion; so that by degrees the literati generally
also patronized him. His responses to questions of
doubt or difficulty were remarkable for their reasonableness;
matters of mere good or bad fortune he did not
care to enter into. In 1631, just after the examination
at Chi-nan, a number of the candidates requested Mr.
Wang to tell them how they would stand on the list;
and, after having examined their essays, he proceeded to
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-297"><a id="Page_ii-297"></a></span>
pass his opinion on their merits.<a id="Anchor-640" title="Go to Footnote 640" href="#Footnote-640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> Among the rest there
happened to be one who was very intimate with another
candidate, not present, whose name was Li Pien; and
who, being an enthusiastic student and a deep thinker,
was confidently expected to appear among the successful
few. Accordingly, the friend submitted Mr. Li’s essay
for inspection; and in a few minutes two characters
appeared on the sand&mdash;namely, “Number one.” After
a short interval this sentence followed:&mdash;“The decision
given just now had reference to Mr. Li’s essay simply as
an essay. Mr. Li’s destiny is darkly obscured, and he
will suffer accordingly. It is strange, indeed, that a man’s
literary powers and his destiny should thus be out of
harmony.<a id="Anchor-641" title="Go to Footnote 641" href="#Footnote-641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> Surely the Examiner will judge of him by his
essay;&mdash;but stay: I will go and see how matters stand.”
Another pause ensued, and then these words were written
down:&mdash;“I have been over to the Examiner’s yamên,
and have found a pretty state of things going on; instead
of reading the candidates’ papers himself, he has
handed them over to his clerks, some half-dozen illiterate
fellows who purchased their own degrees, and who,
in their previous existence, had no status whatever,&mdash;‘hungry
devils’<a id="Anchor-642" title="Go to Footnote 642" href="#Footnote-642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> begging their bread in all directions;
and who, after eight hundred years passed in the murky
gloom of the infernal regions, have lost all discrimination,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-298"><a id="Page_ii-298"></a></span>
like men long buried in a cave and suddenly
transferred to the light of day. Among them may be
one or two who have risen above their former selves, but
the odds are against an essay falling into the hands of
one of these.” The young men then begged to know if
there was any method by which such an evil might be
counteracted; to which the planchette replied that there
was, but, as it was universally understood, there was no
occasion for asking the question. Thereupon they went
off and told Mr. Li, who was so much distressed at the
prediction that he submitted his essay to His Excellency
Sun Tzŭ-mei, one of the finest scholars of the day. This
gentleman examined it, and was so pleased with its literary
merit that he told Li he was quite sure to pass, and
the latter thought no more about the planchette prophecy.
However, when the list came out, there he was
down in the fourth class; and this so much disconcerted
His Excellency Mr. Sun, that he went carefully through
the essay again for fear lest any blemishes might have
escaped his attention. Then he cried out, “Well, I
have always thought this Examiner to be a scholar; he
can never have made such a mistake as this; it must be
the fault of some of his drunken assistants, who don’t
know the mere rudiments of composition.” This fulfilment
of the prophecy raised Mr. Wang very high in the
estimation of the candidates, who forthwith went and
burned incense and invoked the spirit of the planchette,
which at once replied in the following terms:&mdash;“Let
not Mr. Li be disheartened by temporary failure. Let
him rather strive to improve himself still further, and
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-299"><a id="Page_ii-299"></a></span>
next year he may be among the first on the list.” Li
carried out these injunctions; and after a time the story
reached the ears of the Examiner, who gratified Li by
making a public acknowledgment that there had been
some miscarriage of justice at the examination; and the
following year he was passed high up on the list.<a id="Anchor-643" title="Go to Footnote 643" href="#Footnote-643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p>

FRIENDSHIP WITH FOXES.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> man had an enormous stack of straw, as
big as a hill, in which his servants, taking what was daily
required for use, had made quite a hole. In this hole a
fox fixed his abode, and would often shew himself to the
master of the house under the form of an old man.
One day the latter invited the master to walk into the
cave, which he at first declined, but accepted on being
pressed by the fox; and when he got inside, lo! he saw
a long suite of handsome apartments. They then sat
down, and exquisitely perfumed tea and wine were
brought; but the place was so gloomy that there was
no difference between night and day. By-and-by, the
entertainment being over, the guest took his leave; and
on looking back the beautiful rooms and their contents
had all disappeared. The old man himself was in the
habit of going away in the evening and returning with
the first streaks of morning; and as no one was able to
follow him, the master of the house asked him one day
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-301"><a id="Page_ii-301"></a></span>
whither he went. To this he replied that a friend invited
him to take wine; and then the master begged to
be allowed to accompany him, a proposal to which the
old man very reluctantly consented. However, he
seized the master by the arm, and away they went as
though riding on the wings of the wind; and, in about
the time it takes to cook a pot of millet, they reached a
city, and walked into a restaurant, where there were a
number of people drinking together and making a great
noise. The old man led his companion to a gallery
above, from which they could look down on the feasters
below; and he himself went down and brought away
from the tables all kinds of nice food and wine, without
appearing to be seen or noticed by any of the company.
After awhile a man dressed in red garments came forward
and laid upon the table some dishes of cumquats;<a id="Anchor-644" title="Go to Footnote 644" href="#Footnote-644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> and
the master at once requested the old man to go down
and get him some of these. “Ah,” replied the latter,
“that is an upright man: I cannot approach him.”
Thereupon the master said to himself, “By thus seeking
the companionship of a fox, I then am deflected
from the true course. Henceforth I, too, will be an
upright man.” No sooner had he formed this resolution,
than he suddenly lost all control over his body, and fell
from the gallery down among the revellers below. These
gentlemen were much astonished by his unexpected
descent; and he himself, looking up, saw there was no
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-302"><a id="Page_ii-302"></a></span>
gallery to the house, but only a large beam upon which
he had been sitting. He now detailed the whole of the
circumstances, and those present made up a purse for
him to pay his travelling expenses; for he was at Yü-t‘ai&mdash;one

was troubled by the presence of a huge rat, quite as big
as a cat, which ate up all the cats that were set to catch
it. Just then it chanced that among the tribute offerings
sent by some foreign State was a lion-cat, as white
as snow. This cat was accordingly put into the room
where the rat usually appeared; and, the door being
closely shut, a secret watch was kept. By-and-by the rat
came out of its hole and rushed at the cat, which turned
and fled, finally jumping up on the table. The rat followed,
upon which the cat jumped down; and thus they
went on up and down for some time. Those who were
watching said the cat was afraid and of no use; however,
in a little while the rat began to jump less briskly,
and soon after squatted down out of breath. Then the
cat rushed at it, and, seizing the rat by the back of the
neck, shook and shook while its victim squeaked and
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-304"><a id="Page_ii-304"></a></span>
squeaked, until life was extinct. Thus they knew
the cat was not afraid, but merely waited for its adversary
to be fatigued, fleeing when pursued and itself
pursuing the fleeing rat. Truly, many a bad swordsman
may be compared with that rat!</p>

suddenly came across a wolf, which followed him closely,
its mouth watering at the sight of what he was carrying.
The butcher drew his knife and drove the animal off;
and then reflecting that his meat was the attraction, he
determined to hang it up in a tree and fetch it the next
morning. This he accordingly did, and the wolf
followed him no further; but when he went at daylight
to recover his property, he saw something hanging up in
the tree resembling a human corpse. It turned out to
be the wolf, which, in its efforts to get at the meat, had
been caught on the meat-hook like a fish; and as the
skin of a wolf was just then worth ten ounces of silver,
the butcher found himself possessed of quite a little
capital. Here we have a laughable instance of the

and held it firmly, so that the wolf couldn’t stir; and
then, having no other weapon at hand, he took a small
knife he had with him and slit the skin underneath the
wolf’s paw. He now proceeded to blow into it, as

animal lying on the ground, swelled up to the size of a
cow, and unable to bend its legs or close its open
mouth. Thereupon he threw it across his shoulders and
carried it off home. However, such a feat as this could

THE GRATEFUL DOG.</a></h2>

Wu-hu and was returning home with the large profits he
had made, saw on the river bank a butcher tying up a
dog.<a id="Anchor-649" title="Go to Footnote 649" href="#Footnote-649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> He bought the animal for much more than its
value, and carried it along with him in his boat. Now
the boatman had formerly been a bandit; and, tempted
by his passenger’s wealth, ran the boat among the rushes,
and, drawing a knife, prepared to slay him. The trader
begged the man to leave him a whole skin;<a id="Anchor-650" title="Go to Footnote 650" href="#Footnote-650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> so the
boatman wrapped him up in a carpet and threw him into
the river. The dog, on seeing what was done, whined
piteously, and jumping into the river, seized the bundle
with his teeth and did its best to keep the trader above
water until at length a shallow spot was reached. The
animal then succeeded by continuous barking in attracting
the attention of some people on the bank, and
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-309"><a id="Page_ii-309"></a></span>
they hauled the bundle out of the river, and released the
trader who was still alive. The latter asked to be taken
back to Wu-hu where he might look out for the robber
boatman; but just as he was about to start, lo! the dog
was missing. The trader was much distressed at this;
and after spending some days at Wu-hu without being
able to find, among the forest of masts collected there,
the particular boat he wanted, he was on the point of
returning home with a friend, when suddenly the dog re-appeared
and seemed by its barking to invite its master
to follow in a certain direction. This the trader did,
until at length the dog jumped on a boat and seized one
of the boatmen by the leg. No beating could make the
animal let go; and on looking closely at the man, the
trader saw he was the identical boatman who had robbed
and tried to murder him. He had changed his clothes
and also his boat, so that at first he was not recognisable;
he was now, however, arrested, and the whole
of the money was found in his boat. To think that a
dog could show gratitude like that! Truly there are not
a few persons who would be put to shame by that
faithful animal.<a id="Anchor-651" title="Go to Footnote 651" href="#Footnote-651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

THE GREAT TEST.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Before</span> Mr. Yang Ta-hung<a id="Anchor-652" title="Go to Footnote 652" href="#Footnote-652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> was known to fame, he
had already acquired some reputation as a scholar in his
own part of the country, and felt convinced himself that
his was to be no mean destiny. When the list of
successful candidates at the examination was brought to
where he lived, he was in the middle of dinner, and
rushed out with his mouth full to ask if his name was
there or not; and on hearing that it was not, he experienced
such a revulsion of feeling that what he then
swallowed stuck fast like a lump in his chest and made
him very ill. His friends tried to appease him by advising
him to try at the further examination of the
rejected, and when he urged that he had no money,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-311"><a id="Page_ii-311"></a></span>
they subscribed ten ounces of silver and started him on
his way.</p>

<p>That night he dreamt that a man appeared to him
and said, “Ahead of you there is one who can cure your
complaint: beseech him to aid you.” The man then
<span class="nowrap">added&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse_i-0-5">“A tune on the flute ’neath the riverside willow:</div>
<div class="verse_i0">Oh, show no regret when ’tis cast to the billow!”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Next day, Mr. Yang actually met a Taoist priest sitting
beneath a willow tree; and, making him a bow, asked
him to prescribe for his malady. “You have come to the
wrong person,” replied the priest, smiling; “I cannot cure
diseases; but had you asked me for a tune on the flute,
I could have possibly helped you.” Then Mr. Yang
knew that his dream was being fulfilled; and going down
on his knees offered the priest all the money he had.
The priest took it, but immediately threw it into the
river, at which Mr. Yang, thinking how hardly he had
come by this money, was moved to express his regret.
“Aha!” cried the priest at this; “so you are not
indifferent, eh? You’ll find your money all safe on
the bank.” There indeed Mr. Yang found it, at which
he was so much astonished that he addressed the priest
as though he had been an angel. “I am no angel,”
said the priest, “but here comes one;” whereupon Mr.
Yang looked behind him, and the priest seized the opportunity
to give him a slap on the back, crying out at
the same time, “You worldly-minded fellow!” This
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-312"><a id="Page_ii-312"></a></span>
blow brought up the lump of food that had stuck in his
chest, and he felt better at once; but when he looked
round the priest had disappeared.<a id="Anchor-653" title="Go to Footnote 653" href="#Footnote-653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Ch‘ang-ngan there lived a scholar named Chia
Tzŭ-lung, who one day noticed a very refined-looking
stranger; and, on making inquiries about him, learnt that
he was a Mr. Chên, who had taken lodgings hard by.
Accordingly, next day Chia called and sent in his card,
but did not see Chên, who happened to be out at the
time. The same thing occurred thrice; and at length
Chia engaged some one to watch and let him know when
Mr. Chên was at home. However, even then the latter
would not come forth to receive his guest, and Chia had
to go in and rout him out. The two now entered into
conversation, and soon became mutually charmed with
each other; and by-and-by Chia sent off a servant to
bring wine from a neighbouring wine-shop. Mr. Chên
proved himself a pleasant boon companion, and when
the wine was nearly finished, he went to a box, and took
from it some wine-cups and a large and beautiful jade
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-314"><a id="Page_ii-314"></a></span>
tankard, into the latter of which he poured a single cup
of wine, and lo! it was filled to the brim. They then
proceeded to help themselves from the tankard; but
however much they took out, the contents never seemed
to diminish. Chia was astonished at this, and begged
Mr. Chên to tell him how it was done. “Ah,” replied
Mr. Chên, “I tried to avoid making your acquaintance
solely because of your one bad quality&mdash;avarice. The
art I practise is a secret known to the Immortals only:
how can I divulge it to you?” “You do me wrong,”
rejoined Chia, “in thus attributing avarice to me. The
avaricious, indeed, are always poor.” Mr. Chên laughed,
and they separated for that day; but from that time they
were constantly together, and all ceremony was laid
aside between them. Whenever Chia wanted money,
Mr. Chên would bring out a black stone, and, muttering
a charm, would rub it on a tile or a brick, which was
forthwith changed into a lump of silver. This silver he
would give to Chia, and it was always just as much as he
actually required, neither more nor less; and if ever the
latter asked for more, Mr. Chên would rally him on the
subject of avarice. Finally, Chia determined to try and
get possession of this stone; and one day, when Mr.
Chên was sleeping off the fumes of a drinking-bout, he
tried to extract it from his clothes. However, Chên
detected him at once, and declared that they could be
friends no more, and next day he left the place altogether.
About a year afterwards Chia was one day
wandering by the river-bank, when he saw a handsome-looking
stone, marvellously like that in the possession of
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-315"><a id="Page_ii-315"></a></span>
Mr. Chên; and he picked it up at once and carried it
home with him. A few days passed away, and suddenly
Mr. Chên presented himself at Chia’s house, and explained
that the stone in question possessed the property
of changing anything into gold, and had been bestowed
upon him long before by a certain Taoist priest, whom
he had followed as a disciple. “Alas!” added he, “I
got tipsy and lost it; but divination told me where it was,
and if you will now restore it to me, I shall take care to
repay your kindness.” “You have divined rightly,” replied
Chia; “the stone is with me; but recollect, if you please,
that the indigent Kuan Chung<a id="Anchor-655" title="Go to Footnote 655" href="#Footnote-655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> shared the wealth of his
friend Pao Shu.” At this hint Mr. Chên said he would
give Chia one hundred ounces of silver; to which the
latter replied that one hundred ounces was a fair offer,
but that he would far sooner have Mr. Chên teach him
the formula to utter when rubbing the stone on anything,
so as just to try the thing once himself. Mr. Chên was
afraid to do this; whereupon Chia cried out, “You are
an Immortal yourself; you must know well enough that
I would never deceive a friend.” So Mr. Chên was
prevailed upon to teach him the formula, and then Chia
would have tried the art upon the immense stone
washing-block<a id="Anchor-656" title="Go to Footnote 656" href="#Footnote-656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> which was lying near at hand, had not
Mr. Chên seized his arm and begged him not to do any
thing so outrageous. Chia then picked up half a
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-316"><a id="Page_ii-316"></a></span>
brick and laid it on the washing-block, saying to Mr.
Chên, “This little piece is not too much, surely?”
Accordingly, Mr. Chên relaxed his hold and let Chia
proceed; which he did by promptly ignoring the half
brick and quickly rubbing the stone on the washing-block.
Mr. Chên turned pale when he saw him do this,
and made a dash forward to get hold of the stone; but
it was too late, the washing-block was already a solid
mass of silver, and Chia quietly handed him back the stone.
“Alas! alas!” cried Mr. Chên, in despair, “what is to
be done now? For having thus irregularly conferred
wealth upon a mortal,<a id="Anchor-657" title="Go to Footnote 657" href="#Footnote-657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> Heaven will surely punish me.
Oh, if you would save me, give away one hundred
coffins<a id="Anchor-658" title="Go to Footnote 658" href="#Footnote-658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> and one hundred suits of wadded clothes.”
“My friend,” replied Chia, “my object in getting money
was not to hoard it up like a miser.” Mr. Chên was
delighted at this; and during the next three years Chia
engaged in trade, taking care to be all the time fulfilling
his promise to Mr. Chên. At the expiration of that
time Mr. Chên himself reappeared, and, grasping Chia’s
hand, said to him, “Trustworthy and noble friend, when
we last parted the Spirit of Happiness impeached me
before God,<a id="Anchor-659" title="Go to Footnote 659" href="#Footnote-659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> and my name was erased from the list of
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-317"><a id="Page_ii-317"></a></span>
angels. But now that you have carried out my request,
that sentence has accordingly been rescinded. Go on as
you have begun, without ceasing.” Chia asked Mr.
Chên what office he filled in heaven; to which the
latter replied that he was only a fox, who, by a sinless
life, had finally attained to that clear perception of the
Truth which leads to immortality. Wine was then
brought, and the two friends enjoyed themselves together
as of old; and even when Chia had passed the
age of ninety years, that fox still used to visit him from
time to time.</p>

<br/>
RAISING THE DEAD.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. T‘ang P‘ing</span>, who took the highest degree in the
year 1661, was suffering from a protracted illness, when
suddenly he felt, as it were, a warm glow rising from his
extremities upwards. By the time it had reached his
knees, his feet were perfectly numb and without sensation;
and before long his knees and the lower part of
his body were similarly affected. Gradually this glow
worked its way up until it attacked the heart,<a id="Anchor-660" title="Go to Footnote 660" href="#Footnote-660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> and
then some painful moments ensued. Every single incident
of Mr. T‘ang’s life from his boyhood upwards, no
matter how trivial, seemed to surge through his mind,
borne along on the tide of his heart’s blood. At the
revival of any virtuous act of his, he experienced a
delicious feeling of peace and calm; but when any
wicked deed passed before his mind, a painful disturbance
took place within him, like oil boiling and fretting
in a cauldron. He was quite unable to describe the
pangs he suffered; however, he mentioned that he could
recollect having stolen, when only seven or eight years
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-319"><a id="Page_ii-319"></a></span>
old, some young birds from their nest, and having killed
them; and for this alone, he said, boiling blood rushed
through his heart during the space of an ordinary mealtime.
Then when all the acts of his life had passed one
after another in panorama before him, the warm glow
proceeded up his throat, and, entering the brain, issued
out at the top of his head like smoke from a chimney.
By-and-by Mr. T‘ang’s soul escaped from his body by
the same aperture, and wandered far away, forgetting all
about the tenement it had left behind. Just at that
moment a huge giant came along, and, seizing the soul,
thrust it into his sleeve, where it remained cramped and
confined, huddled up with a crowd of others, until
existence was almost unbearable. Suddenly Mr. T‘ang
reflected that Buddha alone could save him from this
horrible state, and forthwith he began to call upon his
holy name.<a id="Anchor-661" title="Go to Footnote 661" href="#Footnote-661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> At the third or fourth invocation he fell
out of the giant’s sleeve, whereupon the latter picked
him up and put him back; but this happened several
times, and at length the giant, wearied of picking him
up, let him lie where he was. The soul lay there for
some time, not knowing in which direction to proceed;
however, it soon recollected that the land of Buddha
was in the west, and westwards accordingly it began to
shape its course. In a little while the soul came upon a
Buddhist priest sitting by the roadside, and, hastening
forwards, respectfully inquired of him which was the
right way. “The record of life and death for scholars,”
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-320"><a id="Page_ii-320"></a></span>
replied the priest, “is in the hands of Wên-ch‘ang<a id="Anchor-662" title="Go to Footnote 662" href="#Footnote-662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> and
Confucius; any application must receive the consent of
both.” The priest then directed Mr. T‘ang on his way,
and the latter journeyed along until he reached a
Confucian temple, in which the Sage was sitting with
his face to the south.<a id="Anchor-663" title="Go to Footnote 663" href="#Footnote-663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> On hearing his business, Confucius
referred him on to Wên-ch‘ang; and, proceeding
onwards in the direction indicated, Mr. T‘ang by-and-by
arrived at what seemed to be the palace of a king,
within which sat Wên-ch‘ang, precisely as we depict him
on earth. “You are an upright man,” replied the God,
in reply to Mr. T‘ang’s prayer, “and are certainly
entitled to a longer span of life; but by this time
your mortal body has become decomposed, and unless
you can secure the assistance of P‘u-sa,<a id="Anchor-664" title="Go to Footnote 664" href="#Footnote-664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> I can give you
no aid.” So Mr. T‘ang set off once more, and hurried
along until he came to a magnificent shrine standing in a
thick grove of tall bamboos; and, entering in, he stood
in the presence of the God, on whose head was the
<i>ushnisha</i>,<a id="Anchor-665" title="Go to Footnote 665" href="#Footnote-665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> whose golden face was round like the full
moon, and at whose side was a green willow-branch
bending gracefully over the lip of a vase. Humbly Mr.
T‘ang prostrated himself on the ground, and repeated
what Wên-ch‘ang had said to him; but P‘u-sa seemed to
think it would be impossible to grant his request, until
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-321"><a id="Page_ii-321"></a></span>
one of the Lohans<a id="Anchor-666" title="Go to Footnote 666" href="#Footnote-666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> who stood by cried out, “O God,
Thou canst perform this miracle: take earth and make
his flesh; take a sprig of willow and make his bones.”
Thereupon P‘u-sa broke off a piece from the willow-branch
in the vase beside him; and, pouring a little of
the water upon the ground, he made clay, and, casting
the whole over Mr. T‘ang’s soul, bade an attendant lead
the body back to the place where his coffin was. At that
instant Mr. T‘ang’s family heard a groan proceeding from
within his coffin, and, on rushing to it and helping out
the lately-deceased man, they found he had quite recovered.
He had then been dead seven days.</p>

FÊNG-SHUI.</a><a id="Anchor-667" title="Go to Footnote 667" href="#Footnote-667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> I-chow there lived a high official named Sung,
whose family were all ardent supporters of Fêng-Shui;
so much so, that even the women-folk read books<a id="Anchor-668" title="Go to Footnote 668" href="#Footnote-668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> on the
subject, and understood the principles of the science.
When Mr. Sung died, his two sons set up separate
establishments,<a id="Anchor-669" title="Go to Footnote 669" href="#Footnote-669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> and each invited to his own house
geomancers from far and near, who had any reputation
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-323"><a id="Page_ii-323"></a></span>
in their art, to select a spot for the dead man’s grave.
By degrees, they had collected together as many as a
hundred a-piece, and every day they would scour the
country round, each at the head of his own particular
regiment. After about a month of this work, both sides
had fixed upon a suitable position for the grave; and
the geomancers engaged by one brother, declared that
if their spot was selected he would certainly some day
be made a marquis, while the other brother was similarly
informed, by his geomancers, that by adopting their
choice he would infallibly rise to the rank of Secretary
of State. Thus, neither brother would give way to the
other, but each set about making the grave in his own
particular place,&mdash;pitching marquees, and arranging
banners, and making all necessary preparations for the
funeral. Then when the coffin arrived at the point where
roads branched off to the two graves, the two brothers,
each leading on his own little army of geomancers, bore
down upon it with a view to gaining possession of the
corpse. From morn till dewy eve the battle raged; and
as neither gained any advantage over the other, the
mourners and friends, who had come to witness the
ceremony of burial, stole away one by one; and the
coolies, who were carrying the coffin, after changing the
poles from one shoulder to another until they were
quite worn out, put the body down by the roadside, and
went off home. It then became necessary to make
some protection for the coffin against the wind and rain;
whereupon the elder brother immediately set about
building a hut close by, in which he purposed leaving
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-324"><a id="Page_ii-324"></a></span>
some of his attendants to keep guard; but he had no
sooner begun than the younger brother followed his
example; and when the elder built a second and third,
the younger also built a second and third; and as this
went on for the space of three whole years, by the end of
that time the place had become quite a little village.
By-and-by, both brothers died, one directly after the
other; and then their two wives determined to cast
to the winds the decision of each party of geomancers.
Accordingly, they went together to the two spots in
question; and after inspecting them carefully, declared
that neither was suitable. The next step was to jointly
engage another set of geomancers, who submitted for
their approval several different spots, and ten days had
hardly passed away before the two women had agreed
upon the position for their father-in-law’s grave, which,
as the wife of the younger brother prophesied, would
surely give to the family a high military degree. So the
body was buried, and within three years Mr. Sung’s
eldest grandson, who had entered as a military cadet,
actually took the corresponding degree to a literary
master of arts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[“Fêng-Shui,” adds the great commentator I Shih-shih, “may
or may not be based upon sound principles; at any rate, to indulge
a morbid belief in it is utter folly; and thus to join issue and fight
while a coffin is relegated to the roadside, is hardly in accordance
with the doctrines of filial piety or fraternal love. Can people
believe that mere position will improve the fortunes of their family?
At any rate, that two women should have thus quietly settled the
matter is certainly worthy of record.”]</p>

THE LINGERING DEATH.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">There</span> was a man in our village who led an exceedingly
disreputable life. One morning when he got up
rather early, two men appeared, and led him away to
the market-place, where he saw a butcher hanging up
half a pig. As they approached, the two men shoved
him with all their might against the dead animal, and
lo! his own flesh began to blend with the pork before
him, while his conductors hurried off in an opposite
direction. By-and-by the butcher wanted to sell a piece
of his meat; and seizing a knife, began to cut off the
quantity required. At every touch of the blade our
disreputable friend experienced a severe pang, which
penetrated into his very marrow; and when, at length,
an old man came and haggled over the weight given
him, crying out for a little bit more fat, or an extra
portion of lean,<a id="Anchor-670" title="Go to Footnote 670" href="#Footnote-670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> then, as the butcher sliced away the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-326"><a id="Page_ii-326"></a></span>
pork ounce by ounce, the pain was unendurable in the
extreme. By about nine o’clock the pork was all sold,
and our hero went home, whereupon his family asked
him what he meant by staying in bed so late.<a id="Anchor-671" title="Go to Footnote 671" href="#Footnote-671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> He then
narrated all that had taken place, and on making inquiries,
they found that the pork-butcher had only just
come home; besides which our friend was able to tell
him every pound of meat he had sold, and every slice
he had cut off. Fancy a man being put to the lingering
death<a id="Anchor-672" title="Go to Footnote 672" href="#Footnote-672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> like this before breakfast!</p>

DREAMING HONOURS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Wang Tzŭ-ngan</span> was a Tung-ch‘ang man, and a
scholar of some repute, but unfortunate at the public
examinations. On one occasion, after having been up
for his master’s degree, his anxiety was very great; and
when the time for the publication of the list drew near,
he drank himself gloriously tipsy, and went and lay
down on the bed. In a few moments a man rushed in,
and cried out, “Sir! you have passed!” whereupon
Wang jumped up, and said, “Give him ten strings of
cash.”<a id="Anchor-673" title="Go to Footnote 673" href="#Footnote-673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> Wang’s wife, seeing he was drunk, and wishing
to keep him quiet, replied, “You go on sleeping: I’ve
given him the money.” So Wang lay down again, but
before long in came another man who informed Wang
that his name was among the successful candidates for
the highest degree. “Why, I haven’t been up for it
yet;” said Wang, “how can I have passed?” “What!
you don’t mean to say you have forgotten the examination?”
answered the man; and then Wang got up once
more, and gave orders to present the informant with ten
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-328"><a id="Page_ii-328"></a></span>
strings of cash. “All right,” replied his wife; “you go
on sleeping: I’ve given him the money.” Another short
interval, and in burst a third messenger to say that Wang
had been elected a member of the National Academy,
and that two official servants had come to escort him
thither. Sure enough there were the two servants bowing
at the bedside, and accordingly Wang directed that
they should be served with wine and meat, which his
wife, smiling at his drunken nonsense, declared had been
already done. Wang now bethought him that he should
go out and receive the congratulations of the neighbours,
and roared out several times to his official servants; but
without receiving any answer. “Go to sleep,” said his
wife, “and wait till I have fetched them;” and after
awhile the servants actually came in; whereupon Wang
stamped and swore at them for being such idiots as to
go away. “What! you wretched scoundrel,” cried the
servants, “are you cursing us in earnest, when we are
only joking with you!” At this Wang’s rage knew no
bounds, and he set upon the men, and gave them a
sound beating, knocking the hat of one off on to the
ground. In the <i xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i>, he himself tumbled over, and his
wife ran in to pick him up, saying, “Shame upon you,
for getting so drunk as this!” “I was only punishing
the servants as they deserved,” replied Wang; “why
do you call me drunk?” “Do you mean the old
woman who cooks our rice and boils the water for
your foot-bath,” asked his wife, smiling, “that you talk
of servants to wait upon your poverty-stricken carcase?”
At this sally all the women burst out in a roar of
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-329"><a id="Page_ii-329"></a></span>
laughter; and Wang, who was just beginning to get
sober, waked up as if from a dream, and knew that
there was no reality in all that had taken place. However,
he recollected the spot where the servant’s hat had
fallen off, and on going thither to look for it, lo! he
beheld a tiny official hat, no larger than a wine-cup,
lying there behind the door. They were all much
astonished at this, and Wang himself cried out, “Formerly
people were thus tricked by devils; and now
foxes are playing the fool with me!”<a id="Anchor-674" title="Go to Footnote 674" href="#Footnote-674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></p>

THE SHE-WOLF AND THE HERD-BOYS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Two</span> herd-boys went up among the hills and found a
wolf’s lair with two little wolves in it. Seizing each of
them one, they forthwith climbed two trees which stood
there, at a distance of forty or fifty paces apart. Before
long the old wolf came back, and, finding her cubs gone,
was in a great state of distress. Just then, one of the
herd-boys pinched his cub and made it squeak; whereupon
the mother ran angrily towards the tree whence the
sound proceeded, and tried to climb up it. At this
juncture, the boy in the other tree pinched the other
cub, and thereby diverted the wolf’s attention in that
direction. But no sooner had she reached the foot of
the second tree, than the boy who had first pinched
his cub did so again, and away ran the old wolf back
to the tree in which her other young one was. Thus
they went on time after time, until the mother was dead
tired, and lay down exhausted on the ground. Then,
when after some time she shewed no signs of moving,
the herd-boys crept stealthily down, and found that the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-331"><a id="Page_ii-331"></a></span>
wolf was already stiff and cold. And truly, it is better
to meet a blustering foe with his hand upon his sword-hilt,
by retiring within doors, and leaving him to
fret his violence away unopposed; for such is but the
behaviour of brute beasts, of which men thus take
advantage.</p>

<br/>
ADULTERATION</a><a id="Anchor-675" title="Go to Footnote 675" href="#Footnote-675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> PUNISHED.</h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> Chin-ling there lived a seller of spirits, who was
in the habit of adulterating his liquor with water and
a certain drug, the effect of which was that even a few
cups would make the strongest-headed man as drunk
as a jelly-fish.<a id="Anchor-676" title="Go to Footnote 676" href="#Footnote-676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> Thus his shop acquired a reputation for
having a good article on sale, and by degrees he became
a rich man. One morning, on getting up, he found a
fox lying drunk alongside of the spirit vat; and tying
its legs together, he was about to fetch a knife, when
suddenly the fox waked up, and began pleading for
its life, promising in return to do anything the spirit-merchant
might require. The latter then released the
animal, which instantly changed into the form of a
human being. Now, at that very time, the wife of a
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-333"><a id="Page_ii-333"></a></span>
neighbour was suffering under fox influence, and this
recently-transformed animal confessed to the spirit-merchant
that it was he who had been troubling her.
Thereupon the spirit-merchant, who knew the lady
in question to be a celebrated beauty, begged his fox
friend to secretly introduce him to her. After raising
some objections, the fox at length consented, and conducted
the spirit-merchant to a cave, where he gave him
a suit of serge clothes, which he said had belonged to
his late brother, and in which he told him he could
easily go. The merchant put them on, and returned
home, when to his great delight he observed that no
one could see him, but that if he changed into his
ordinary clothes everybody could see him as before.
Accordingly he set off with the fox for his neighbour’s
house; and, when they arrived, the first thing they beheld
was a charm on the wall, like a great wriggling dragon.
At this the fox was greatly alarmed, and said, “That
scoundrel of a priest! I can’t go any farther.” He then
ran off home, leaving the spirit-merchant to proceed by
himself. The latter walked quietly in to find that the
dragon on the wall was a real one, and preparing to fly
at him, so he too turned, and ran away as fast as his
legs could carry him. The fact was that the family had
engaged a priest to drive away the fox influence; and
he, not being able to go at the moment himself, gave
them this charm to stick up on the wall. The following
day the priest himself came, and, arranging an altar,
proceeded to exorcise the fox. All the villagers crowded
round to see, and among others was the spirit-merchant,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-334"><a id="Page_ii-334"></a></span>
who, in the middle of the ceremony, suddenly changed
colour, and hurried out of the front door, where he fell
on the ground in the shape of a fox, having his clothes
still hanging about his arms and legs. The bystanders
would have killed him on the spot, but his wife begged
them to spare him; and the priest let her take the fox
home, where in a few days it died.</p>

<br/>
A CHINESE SOLOMON.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">In</span> our district there lived two men, named Hu
Ch‘êng and Fêng Ngan, between whom there existed an
old feud. The former, however, was the stronger of the
two; and accordingly Fêng disguised his feelings under
a specious appearance of friendship, though Hu never
placed much faith in his professions. One day they
were drinking together, and being both of them rather
the worse for liquor, they began to brag of the various
exploits they had achieved. “What care I for poverty,”
cried Hu, “when I can lay a hundred ounces of silver
on the table at a moment’s notice?” Now Fêng was
well aware of the state of Hu’s affairs, and did not
hesitate to scout such pretensions, until Hu further informed
him in perfect seriousness that the day before he
had met a merchant travelling with a large sum of
money and had tumbled him down a dry well by the
wayside; in confirmation of which he produced several
hundred ounces of silver, which really belonged to a
brother-in-law on whose behalf he was managing some
negotiation for the purchase of land. When they
separated, Fêng went off and gave information to the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-336"><a id="Page_ii-336"></a></span>
magistrate of the place, who summoned Hu to answer to
the charge. Hu then told the actual facts of the case,
and his brother-in-law and the owner of the land in
question corroborated his statement. However, on
examining the dry well by letting a man down with a
rope round him, lo! there was a headless corpse lying at
the bottom. Hu was horrified at this, and called
Heaven to witness that he was innocent; whereupon
the magistrate ordered him twenty or thirty blows on the
mouth for lying in the presence of such irrefragable
proof, and cast him into the condemned cell, where he
lay loaded with chains. Orders were issued that the
corpse was not to be removed, and a notification was
made to the people, calling upon the relatives of the
deceased to come forward and claim the body. Next day
a woman appeared, and said deceased was her husband;
that his name was Ho, and that he was proceeding on
business with a large sum of money about him when he
was killed by Hu. The magistrate observed that possibly
the body in the well might not be that of her
husband, to which the woman replied that she felt sure
it was; and accordingly the corpse was brought up and
examined, when the woman’s story was found to be
correct. She herself did not go near the body, but
stood at a little distance making the most doleful
lamentations; until at length the magistrate said, “We
have got the murderer, but the body is not complete;
you go home and wait until the head has been discovered,
when life shall be given for life.” He then summoned
Hu before him, and told him to produce the head
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-337"><a id="Page_ii-337"></a></span>
by the next day under penalty of severe torture; but
Hu only wandered about with the guard sent in charge
of him, crying and lamenting his fate, but finding
nothing. The instruments of torture were then produced,
and preparations were made as if for torturing
Hu; however, they were not applied,<a id="Anchor-677" title="Go to Footnote 677" href="#Footnote-677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> and finally the
magistrate sent him back to prison, saying, “I suppose
that in your hurry you didn’t notice where you dropped
the head.” The woman was then brought before him
again; and on learning that her relatives consisted only
of one uncle, the magistrate remarked, “A young
woman like you, left alone in the world, will hardly be
able to earn a livelihood. [Here she burst into tears
and implored the magistrate’s pity.] The punishment of
the guilty man has been already decided upon, but until
we get the head, the case cannot be closed. As soon as
it is closed, the best thing you can do is to marry again.
A young woman like yourself should not be in and out
of a police-court.” The woman thanked the magistrate
and retired; and the latter issued a notice to the people,
calling upon them to make a search for the head. On
the following day, a man named Wang, a fellow villager
of the deceased, reported that he had found the missing
head; and his report proving to be true, he was rewarded
with 1,000 <i>cash</i>. The magistrate now summoned
the woman’s uncle above-mentioned, and told
him that the case was complete, but that as it involved
such an important matter as the life of a human being,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-338"><a id="Page_ii-338"></a></span>
there would necessarily be some delay in closing it for
good and all.<a id="Anchor-678" title="Go to Footnote 678" href="#Footnote-678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> “Meanwhile,” added the magistrate,
“your niece is a young woman and has no children;
persuade her to marry again and so keep herself out of
these troubles, and never mind what people may say.”<a id="Anchor-679" title="Go to Footnote 679" href="#Footnote-679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>
The uncle at first refused to do this; upon which the
magistrate was obliged to threaten him until he was
ultimately forced to consent. At this, the woman appeared
before the magistrate to thank him for what he
had done; whereupon the latter gave out that any
person who was willing to take the woman to wife was to
present himself at his yamên. Immediately afterwards
an application was made&mdash;by the very man who had
found the head. The magistrate then sent for the
woman and asked her if she could say who was the real
murderer; to which she replied that Hu Chêng had
done the deed. “No!” cried the magistrate; “it was
not he. It was you and this man here. [Here both
began loudly to protest their innocence.] I have long
known this; but, fearing to leave the smallest loophole
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-339"><a id="Page_ii-339"></a></span>
for escape, I have tarried thus long in elucidating the
circumstances. How [to the woman], before the corpse
was removed from the well, were you so certain that it
was your husband’s body? <em>Because you already knew he
was dead.</em> And does a trader who has several hundred
ounces of silver about him dress as shabbily as your
husband was dressed? And you, [to the man], how did
you manage to find the head so readily? <em>Because you
were in a hurry to marry the woman.</em>” The two culprits
stood there as pale as death, unable to utter a word in
their defence; and on the application of torture both
confessed the crime. For this man, the woman’s
paramour, had killed her husband, curiously enough,
about the time of Hu Chêng’s braggart joke. Hu was
accordingly released, but Fêng suffered the penalty of a
false accuser; he was severely bambooed, and banished
for three years. The case was thus brought to a close
without the wrongful punishment of a single person.</p>

THE ROC.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Two</span> herons built their nests under one of the ornaments
on the roof of a temple at Tientsin. The
accumulated dust of years in the shrine below concealed
a huge serpent, having the diameter of a washing-basin;
and whenever the heron’s young were ready to fly, the
reptile proceeded to the nest and swallowed every one of
them, to the great distress of the bereaved parents. This
took place three years consecutively, and people thought
the birds would build there no more. However, the
following year they came again; and when the time was
drawing nigh for their young ones to take wing, away
they flew, and remained absent for nearly three days.
On their return, they went straight to the nest, and began
amidst much noisy chattering to feed their young ones
as usual. Just then the serpent crawled up to reach his
prey; and as he was nearing the nest the parent-birds
flew out and screamed loudly in mid-air. Immediately,
there was heard a mighty flapping of wings, and darkness
came over the face of the earth, which the astonished
spectators now perceived to be caused by a huge bird
obscuring the light of the sun. Down it swooped with
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-341"><a id="Page_ii-341"></a></span>
the speed of wind or falling rain, and, striking the
serpent with its talons, tore its head off at a blow,
bringing down at the same time several feet of the
masonry of the temple. Then it flew away, the herons
accompanying it as though escorting a guest. The nest
too had come down, and of the two young birds one
was killed by the fall; the other was taken by the priests
and put in the bell tower, whither the old birds returned
to feed it until thoroughly fledged, when it spread its
wings and was gone.<a id="Anchor-680" title="Go to Footnote 680" href="#Footnote-680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">A sportsman</span> of Tientsin, having snared a wild goose,
was followed to his home by the gander, which flew
round and round him in great distress, and only went
away at nightfall. Next day, when the sportsman went
out, there was the bird again; and at length it alighted
quite close to his feet. He was on the point of seizing
it when suddenly it stretched out its neck and disgorged
a piece of pure gold; whereupon, the sportsman, understanding
what the bird meant, cried out, “I see! this
is to ransom your mate, eh?” Accordingly, he at once
released the goose, and the two birds flew away with
many expressions of their mutual joy, leaving to the
sportsman nearly three ounces of pure gold. Can, then,
mere birds have such feelings as these? Of all sorrows
there is no sorrow like separation from those we love;
and it seems that the same holds good even of dumb
animals.</p>

THE ELEPHANTS AND THE LION.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A huntsman</span> of Kuang-si, who was out on the hills
with his bow and arrows, lay down to rest awhile, and
unwittingly fell fast asleep. As he was slumbering, an
elephant came up, and, coiling his trunk around the
man, carried him off. The latter gave himself up for
dead; but before long the elephant had deposited him
at the foot of a tall tree, and had summoned a whole
herd of comrades, who crowded about the huntsman as
though asking his assistance. The elephant who had
brought him went and lay down under the tree, and first
looked up into its branches and then looked down at the
man, apparently requesting him to get up into the tree.
So the latter jumped on the elephant’s back and then
clambered up to the topmost branch, not knowing what
he was expected to do next. By-and-by a lion<a id="Anchor-682" title="Go to Footnote 682" href="#Footnote-682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> arrived,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-344"><a id="Page_ii-344"></a></span>
and from among the frightened herd chose out a fat
elephant, which he seemed as though about to devour.
The others remained there trembling, not daring to
run away, but looking wistfully up into the tree. Thereupon
the huntsman drew an arrow from his quiver and
shot the lion dead, at which all the elephants below
made him a grateful obeisance. He then descended,
when the elephant lay down again and invited him to
mount by pulling at his clothes with its trunk. This he
did, and was carried to a place where the animal
scratched the ground with its foot, and revealed to him
a vast number of old tusks. He jumped down and
collected them in a bundle, after which the elephant
conveyed him to a spot whence he easily found his way
home.</p>

<br/>
THE HIDDEN TREASURE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Li Yüeh-shêng</span> was the second son of a rich old
man who used to bury his money, and who was known
to his fellow-townsmen as “Old Crocks.” One day the
father fell sick, and summoned his sons to divide the
property between them.<a id="Anchor-683" title="Go to Footnote 683" href="#Footnote-683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> He gave four-fifths to the
elder and only one-fifth to the younger, saying to the
latter, “It is not that I love your brother more than I
love you: I have other money stored away, and when
you are alone I will hand that over to you.” A few days
afterwards the old man grew worse, and Yüeh-shêng,
afraid that his father might die at any moment, seized an
opportunity of seeing him alone to ask about the money
that he himself was to receive. “Ah,” replied the dying
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-346"><a id="Page_ii-346"></a></span>
man, “the sum of our joys and of our sorrows is determined
by fate. You are now happy in the possession of
a virtuous wife, and have no right to an increase of
wealth.” For, as a matter of fact, this second son was
married to a lady from the Ch‘ê family whose virtue
equalled that of any of the heroines of history: hence
his father’s remark. Yüeh-shêng, however, was not satisfied,
and implored to be allowed to have the money;
and at length the old man got angry and said, “You are
only just turned twenty; you have known none of the
trials of life, and were I to give a thousand ounces of
gold, it would soon be all spent. Go! and, until you
have drunk the cup of bitterness to its dregs, expect no
money from me.” Now Yüeh-shêng was a filial son, and
when his father spoke thus he did not venture to say any
more, and hoped for his speedy recovery that he might
have a chance of coaxing him to comply with his request.
But the old man got worse and worse, and at
length died; whereupon the elder brother took no
trouble about the funeral ceremonies, leaving it all to
the younger, who, being an open-handed fellow, made no
difficulties about the expense. The latter was also fond
of seeing a great deal of company at his house, and his
wife often had to get three or four meals a-day ready for
guests; and, as her husband did very little towards
looking after his affairs, and was further sponged upon
by all the needy ones of the neighbourhood, they were
soon reduced to a state of poverty. The elder brother
helped them to keep body and soul together, but he died
shortly afterwards, and this resource was cut off from
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-347"><a id="Page_ii-347"></a></span>
them. Then, by dint of borrowing in the spring and
repaying in the autumn,<a id="Anchor-684" title="Go to Footnote 684" href="#Footnote-684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> they still managed to exist,
until at last it came to parting with their land, and they
were left actually destitute. At that juncture their eldest
son died, followed soon after by his mother; and Yüeh-shêng
was left almost by himself in the world. He now
married the widow of a sheep-dealer, who had a little
capital; and she was very strict with him, and wouldn’t
let him waste time and money with his friends. One
night his father appeared to him and said, “My son, you
have drained your cup of bitterness to the dregs. You
shall now have the money. I will bring it to you.”
When Yüeh-shêng woke up, he thought it was merely a
poor man’s dream; but the next day, while laying the
foundations of a wall, he did come upon a quantity of
gold. And then he knew what his father had meant by
“when you are alone;” for of those about him at that
time, more than half were gone.</p>

THE BOATMEN OF LAO-LUNG.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">When</span> His Excellency Chu was Viceroy of Kuangtung,
there were constant complaints from the traders of
mysterious disappearances; sometimes as many as three
or four of them disappearing at once and never being
seen or heard of again. At length the number of such
cases, filed of course against some person or persons
unknown, multiplied to such an extent that they were
simply put on record, and but little notice was further
taken of them by the local officials. Thus, when His
Excellency entered upon his duties, he found more than
a hundred plaints of the kind, besides innumerable
cases in which the missing man’s relatives lived at
a distance and had not instituted proceedings. The
mystery so preyed upon the new Viceroy’s mind that he
lost all appetite for food; and when, finally, all the
inquiries he had set on foot resulted in no clue to an
elucidation of these strange disappearances, then His
Excellency proceeded to wash and purify himself, and,
having notified the Municipal God,<a id="Anchor-685" title="Go to Footnote 685" href="#Footnote-685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> he took to fasting
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-349"><a id="Page_ii-349"></a></span>
and sleeping in his study alone. While he was in
ecstasy, lo! an official entered, holding a tablet in his
hand, and said that he had come from the Municipal
temple with the following instructions to the <span class="nowrap">Viceroy:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse_i-0-5">“Snow on the whiskers descending:</div>
<div class="verse_i0">Live clouds falling from heaven:</div>
<div class="verse_i0">Wood in water buoyed up:</div>
<div class="verse_i0">In the wall an opening effected.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The official then retired, and the Viceroy waked up;
but it was only after a night of tossing and turning that
he hit upon what seemed to him the solution of the
enigma. “The first line,” argued he, “must signify <em>old</em>
(<i>lao</i> in Chinese); the second refers to the <em>dragon</em><a id="Anchor-686" title="Go to Footnote 686" href="#Footnote-686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> (<i>lung</i>
in Chinese); the third is clearly a <em>boat;</em> and the fourth
a <em>door</em> here taken in its secondary sense&mdash;<em>man</em>.” Now,
to the east of the province, not far from the pass by
which traders from the north connect their line of trade
with the southern seas, there was actually a ferry known
as the Old Dragon (<i>Lao-lung</i>); and thither the Viceroy
immediately despatched a force to arrest those employed
in carrying people backwards and forwards. More than
fifty men were caught, and they all confessed at once
without the application of torture. In fact, they were
bandits under the guise of boatmen;<a id="Anchor-687" title="Go to Footnote 687" href="#Footnote-687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> and after beguiling
passengers on board, they would either drug them or
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-350"><a id="Page_ii-350"></a></span>
burn stupefying incense until they were senseless, finally
cutting them open and putting a large stone inside to
make the body sink. Such was the horrible story, the
discovery of which brought throngs to the Viceroy’s door
to serenade him in terms of gratitude and praise.<a id="Anchor-688" title="Go to Footnote 688" href="#Footnote-688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p>

THE PIOUS SURGEON.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">A certain</span> veterinary surgeon, named Hou, was
carrying food to his field labourers, when suddenly a
whirlwind arose in his path. Hou seized a spoon and
poured out a libation of gruel, whereupon the wind immediately
dropped. On another occasion, he was
wandering about the municipal temple when he noticed
an image of Liu Ch‘üan presenting the melon,<a id="Anchor-689" title="Go to Footnote 689" href="#Footnote-689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> in whose
eye was a great splotch of dirt. “Dear me, Sir Liu!”
cried Hou, “who has been ill-using you like this?”
He then scraped away the dirt with his finger-nail, and
passed on. Some years afterwards, as he was lying down
very ill, two lictors walked in and carried him off to a
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-352"><a id="Page_ii-352"></a></span>
yamên, where they insisted on his bribing them heavily.
Hou was at his wits’ end what to do; but just at that
moment a personage dressed in green robes came forth,
who was greatly astonished at seeing him there, and
asked what it all meant. Our hero at once explained;
whereupon the man in green turned upon the lictors and
abused them for not shewing proper respect to Mr. Hou.
Meanwhile a drum sounded like the roll of thunder, and
the man in green told Hou that it was for the morning
session, and that he would have to attend. Leading
Hou within he put him in his proper place, and, promising
to inquire into the charge against him, went forward
and whispered a few words to one of the clerks.
“Oh,” said the latter, advancing and making a bow to
the veterinary surgeon, “yours is a trifling matter. We
shall merely have to confront you with a horse, and then
you can go home again.” Shortly afterwards, Hou’s
case was called; upon which he went forward and knelt
down, as did also a horse which was prosecuting him.
The judge now informed Hou that he was accused by
the horse of having caused its death by medicines, and
asked him if he pleaded guilty or not guilty. “My
lord,” replied Hou, “the prosecutor was attacked by the
cattle-plague, for which I treated him accordingly; and
he actually recovered from the disease, though he died
on the following day. Am I to be held responsible for
that?” The horse now proceeded to tell his story; and
after the usual cross-examination and cries for justice,
the judge gave orders to look up the horse’s term of life
in the Book of Fate. Therein it appeared that the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-353"><a id="Page_ii-353"></a></span>
animal’s destiny had doomed it to death on the very day
on which it had died; whereupon the judge cried out,
“Your term of years had already expired; why bring
this false charge? Away with you!” and turning to
Hou, the judge added, “You are a worthy man, and
may be permitted to live.” The lictors were accordingly
instructed to escort him back, and with them went out
both the clerk and the man in green clothes, who bade
the lictors take every possible care of Hou by the way.
“You gentlemen are very kind,” said Hou, “but I
haven’t the honour of your acquaintance, and should be
glad to know to whom I am so much indebted.”
“Three years ago,” replied the man in green, “I was
travelling in your neighbourhood, and was suffering very
much from thirst, which you relieved for me by a few
spoonfuls of gruel. I have not forgotten that act.”
“And my name,” observed the other, “is Liu Ch‘üan.
You once took a splotch of dirt out of my eye that was
troubling me very much. I am only sorry that the wine
and food we have down here is unsuitable to offer you.
Farewell.” Hou now understood all that had happened,
and went off home with the two lictors where he would
have regaled them with some refreshment, but they
refused to take even a cup of tea. He then waked up
and found that he had been dead for two days. From
this time forth he led a more virtuous life than ever,
always pouring out libations to Liu Ch‘üan at all the
festivals of the year. Thus he reached the age of eighty,
a hale and hearty man, still able to sit in the saddle;
until one day he met Liu Ch‘üan riding on horseback, as
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-354"><a id="Page_ii-354"></a></span>
if about to make a long journey. After a little friendly
conversation, the latter said to him, “Your time is up,
and the warrant for your arrest is already issued; but I
have ordered the constables to delay awhile, and you can
now spend three days in preparing for death, at the expiration

purchased a small appointment for you in the realms
below,<a id="Anchor-690" title="Go to Footnote 690" href="#Footnote-690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> by which you will be more comfortable.” So
Hou went home and told his wife and children; and
after collecting his friends and relatives, and making all
necessary preparations, on the evening of the fourth day
he cried out, “Liu Ch‘üan has come!” and, getting into
his coffin,<a id="Anchor-691" title="Go to Footnote 691" href="#Footnote-691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> lay down and died.</p>

<br/>
ANOTHER SOLOMON.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">At</span> T‘ai-yüan there lived a middle-aged woman with
her widowed daughter-in-law. The former was on terms
of too great intimacy with a notably bad character of the
neighbourhood; and the latter, who objected very
strongly to this, did her best to keep the man from
the house. The elder woman accordingly tried to send
the other back to her family, but she would not go; and
at length things came to such a pass that the mother-in-law
actually went to the mandarin of the place and
charged her daughter-in-law with the offence she herself
was committing. When the mandarin inquired the
name of the man concerned, she said she had only seen
him in the dark and didn’t know who he was, referring
him for information to the accused. The latter, on
being summoned, gave the man’s name, but retorted the
charge on her mother-in-law; and when the man was
confronted with them, he promptly declared both their
stories to be false. The mandarin, however, said there
was a <i xml:lang="fr">primâ facie</i> case against him, and ordered him to
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-356"><a id="Page_ii-356"></a></span>
be severely beaten, whereupon he confessed that it was
the daughter-in-law whom he went to visit. This the
woman herself flatly denied, even under torture; and on
being released, appealed to a higher court, with a very
similar result. Thus the case dragged on, until a Mr.
Sun, who was well-known for his judicial acumen, was
appointed district magistrate at that place. Calling the
parties before him, he bade his lictors prepare stones
and knives, at which they were much exercised in
their minds, the severest tortures allowed by law being
merely gyves and fetters.<a id="Anchor-692" title="Go to Footnote 692" href="#Footnote-692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> However, everything was
got ready, and the next day Mr. Sun proceeded with his
investigation. After hearing all that each one of the
three had to say, he delivered the following judgment:&mdash;“The
case is a simple one; for although I cannot say
which of you two women is the guilty one, there is no
doubt about the man, who has evidently been the means
of bringing discredit on a virtuous family. Take those
stones and knives there and put him to death. I will
be responsible.” Thereupon the two women began to
stone the man, especially the younger one, who seized
the biggest stones she could see and threw them at him
with all the might of her pent-up anger; while the
mother-in-law chose small stones and struck him on non-vital
parts.<a id="Anchor-693" title="Go to Footnote 693" href="#Footnote-693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> So with the knives: the daughter-in-law
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-357"><a id="Page_ii-357"></a></span>
would have killed him at the first blow, had not the
mandarin stopped her, and said, “Hold! I now know
who is the guilty woman.” The mother-in-law was then
tortured until she confessed, and the case was thus terminated.</p>

THE INCORRUPT OFFICIAL.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Mr. Wu</span>, Sub-prefect of Chi-nan, was an upright man,
and would have no share in the bribery and corruption
which was extensively carried on, and at which the
higher authorities connived, and in the proceeds of which
they actually shared. The Prefect tried to bully him into
adopting a similar plan, and went so far as to abuse him
in violent language; upon which Mr. Wu fired up and
exclaimed, “Though I am but a subordinate official,
you should impeach me for anything you have against
me in the regular way; you have not the right to abuse
me thus. Die I may, but I will never consent to degrade
my office and turn aside the course of justice for
the sake of filthy lucre.” At this outbreak the Prefect
changed his tone, and tried to soothe him....
[How dare people accuse the age of being corrupt,
when it is themselves who will not walk in the straight
path.] One day after this a certain fox-medium<a id="Anchor-694" title="Go to Footnote 694" href="#Footnote-694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> came
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-359"><a id="Page_ii-359"></a></span>
to the Prefect’s yamên just as a feast was in full swing,
and was thus addressed by a guest:&mdash;“You who pretend
to know everything, say how many officials there are in
this Prefecture.” “<em>One</em>,” replied the medium; at which
the company laughed heartily, until the medium continued,
“There are really seventy-two holders of office,
but Mr. Sub-prefect Wu is the only one who can justly
be called an official.”</p>

<h2><a id="appendix-a">APPENDIX A.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Visitors</span> to Chinese temples of the Taoist persuasion usually
make at once for what is popularly known amongst foreigners as
the “Chamber of Horrors.” These belong specially to Taoism, or
the ethics of Right in the abstract, as opposed to abstract Wrong,
and are not found in temples consecrated to the religion of Buddha.
Modern Taoism, however, once a purely metaphysical system, is
now so leavened with the superstitions of Buddhism, and has borrowed
so much material from its younger rival, that an ordinary
Chinaman can hardly tell one from the other, and generally regards
them as to all intents and purposes the same. These rightly-named
Chambers of Horrors&mdash;for Madame Tussaud has nothing more
ghastly to show in the whole of her wonderful collection&mdash;represent
the Ten Courts of Purgatory, through some or all of which
erring souls must pass before they are suffered to be born again into
the world under another form, or transferred to the eternal bliss
reserved for the righteous alone. As a description of these Ten
Courts may not be uninteresting to some of my readers, and as the
subject has a direct bearing upon many of the stories in the previous
collection, I hereto append my translation of a well-known Taoist
work<a id="Anchor-695" title="Go to Footnote 695" href="#Footnote-695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> which is circulated gratuitously all over the Chinese Empire
by people who are anxious to lay up a store of good works against
the day of reckoning to come. Those who are acquainted with
Dante’s <cite>Divine Comedy</cite> will recollect that the poet’s idea of a
Christian Purgatory was a series of nine lessening circles arranged
one above the other, so as to form a cone. The Taoist believes
that his Purgatory consists of Ten Courts of Justice situated in
different positions at the bottom of a great ocean which lies down in
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-362"><a id="Page_ii-362"></a></span>
the depths of the earth. These are sub-divided into special wards,
different forms of torture being inflicted in each. A perusal of this
work will shew what punishments the wicked Chinaman has to
expect in the unseen world, and by what means he may hope to
obtain a partial or complete remission of his sins.</p>

<h3 class="panorama"><i>The “Divine Panorama,” published by the Mercy of Yü Ti,</i><a id="Anchor-696" title="Go to Footnote 696" href="#Footnote-696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> <i>that
Men and Women may repent them of their Faults and make Atonement
for their Crimes.</i></h3>

<p>On the birthday of the Saviour P‘u-sa,<a id="Anchor-697" title="Go to Footnote 697" href="#Footnote-697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> as the spirits of Purgatory
were thronging round to offer their congratulations, the ruler of the
Infernal Regions spake as follows:&mdash;“My wish is to release all
souls, and every moon as this day comes round I would wholly or
partially remit the punishment of erring shades, and give them life
once more in one of the Six Paths.<a id="Anchor-698" title="Go to Footnote 698" href="#Footnote-698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> But alas! the wicked are
many and the virtuous few. Nevertheless, the punishments in the
dark region are too severe, and require some modification. Any
wicked soul that repents and induces one or two others to do likewise
shall be allowed to set this off against the punishments which
should be inflicted.” The Judges of the Ten Courts of Purgatory
then agreed that all who led virtuous lives from their youth upwards
shall be escorted at their death to the land of the Immortals; that
all whose balance of good and evil is exact shall escape the bitterness
of the Three States,<a id="Anchor-699" title="Go to Footnote 699" href="#Footnote-699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> and be born again among men; that those
who have repaid their debts of gratitude and friendship, and fulfilled
their destiny, yet have a balance of evil against them, shall pass
through the various Courts of Purgatory and then be born again
amongst men, rich, poor, old, young, diseased or crippled, to be
put a second time upon trial. Then, if they behave well they may
enter into some happy state; but if badly, they will be dragged by
horrid devils through all the Courts, suffering bitterly as they go,
and will again be born, to endure in life the uttermost of poverty
and wretchedness, in death the everlasting tortures of hell. Those
who are disloyal, unfilial, who commit suicide, take life, or disbelieve
the doctrine of Cause and Effect,<a id="Anchor-700" title="Go to Footnote 700" href="#Footnote-700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> saying to themselves that when a
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-363"><a id="Page_ii-363"></a></span>
man dies there is an end of him, that when he has lost his skin<a id="Anchor-701" title="Go to Footnote 701" href="#Footnote-701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> he
has already suffered the worst that can befall him, that living men
can be tortured, but no one ever saw a man’s ghost in the pillory,
that after death all is unknown, etc., etc.,&mdash;truly these men do not
know that the body alone perishes but the soul lives for ever and
ever; and that whatsoever evil they do in this life, the same will be
done unto them in the life to come. All who commit such crimes
are handed over to the everlasting tortures of hell; for alas! in
spite of the teachings of the Three Systems<a id="Anchor-702" title="Go to Footnote 702" href="#Footnote-702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> some will persist in
regarding these warnings as vain and empty talk. Lightly they
speak of Divine mercy, and knowingly commit many crimes, not
more than one in a hundred ever coming to repentance. Therefore
the punishments of Purgatory were strictly carried out and the
tortures dreadfully severe. But now it has been mercifully ordained
that any man or woman, young, old, weak or strong, who may have
sinned in any way, shall be permitted to obtain remission of the
same by keeping his or her thoughts constantly fixed on P‘u-sa and
on the birthdays of the Judges of the Ten Courts, by fasting and
prayer, and by vows never to sin again. Or for every good work
done in life they shall be allowed to escape one ward in the Courts
below. From this rule to be excepted disloyal ministers, unfilial
sons, suicides, those who plot in secret against good people, those
who are struck by lightning (<i><abbr title="literally">lit.</abbr></i> thunder), those who perish by flood
or fire, by wild animals or poisonous reptiles<a id="Anchor-703" title="Go to Footnote 703" href="#Footnote-703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>&mdash;these to pass
through all the Courts and be punished according to their deserts.
All other sinners to be allowed to claim their good works as a set-off
against evil, thus partly escaping the agonies of hell and receiving
some reward for their virtuous deeds.</p>

<p>This account of man’s wickedness on the earth and the punishments
in store for him was written in language intelligible to every
man and woman, and was submitted for the approval of P‘u-sa, the
intention being to wait the return<a id="Anchor-704" title="Go to Footnote 704" href="#Footnote-704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> of some virtuous soul among the
sons of men, and by these means publish it all over the earth. When
P‘u-sa saw what had been done, he said it was good; and on the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-364"><a id="Page_ii-364"></a></span>
3rd of 8th moon proceeded with the ten Judges of Purgatory to lay
this book before God.<a id="Anchor-705" title="Go to Footnote 705" href="#Footnote-705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a></p>

<p>Then God said, “Good indeed! Good indeed! henceforth let all
spirits take note of any mortal who vows to lead a virtuous life and,
repenting, promises to sin no more. Two punishments shall be
remitted him. And if, in addition to this, he succeeds in doing five
virtuous acts, then he shall escape all punishment and be born
again in some happy state&mdash;if a woman she shall be born as a man.
But more than five virtuous acts shall enable such a soul to obtain
the salvation of others, and redeem wife and family from the
tortures of hell. Let these regulations be published in the <cite>Divine
Panorama</cite> and circulated on earth by the spirits of the City
Guardian.<a id="Anchor-706" title="Go to Footnote 706" href="#Footnote-706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> In fear and trembling obey this decree and carry it
reverently into effect.”</p>


<h3>THE FIRST COURT.</h3>

<p>His Infernal Majesty Ch‘in Kuang is specially in charge of the
register of life and death both for old and young, and presides at
the judgment-seat in the lower regions. His court is situated in the
great Ocean, away beyond the Wu-chiao rock,<a id="Anchor-707" title="Go to Footnote 707" href="#Footnote-707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> far to the west
near the murky road which leads to the Yellow Springs.<a id="Anchor-708" title="Go to Footnote 708" href="#Footnote-708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> Every
man and woman dying in old age whose fate it is to be born again
into the world, if their tale of good and evil works is equally
balanced, are sent to the First Court, and thence transferred back
to Life, male becoming female, female male, rich poor, and poor
rich, according to their several deserts. But those whose good deeds
are outnumbered by their bad are sent to a terrace on the right of
the Court, called the Terrace of the Mirror of Sin, ten feet in
height. The mirror is about fifty feet<a id="Anchor-709" title="Go to Footnote 709" href="#Footnote-709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> in circumference and
hangs towards the east. Above are seven characters written horizontally:&mdash;“Sin
Mirror Terrace upon no good men.” There the
wicked souls are able to see the naughtiness of their own hearts
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-365"><a id="Page_ii-365"></a></span>
while they were among the living, and the danger of death and hell.
Then do they realize the <span class="nowrap">proverb,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse_i-0-5">“Ten thousand taels of yellow gold cannot be brought away:</div>
<div class="verse_i0">But every crime will tell its tale upon the judgment day.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">When the souls have been to the Terrace and seen their wickednesses,
they are forwarded into the Second Court, where they are
tortured and dismissed to the proper hell.</p>

<p>Should there be any one enjoying life without reflecting that
Heaven and Earth produce mortals, that father and mother bring
the child to maturity&mdash;truly no easy matter; and, ignoring the four
obligations,<a id="Anchor-710" title="Go to Footnote 710" href="#Footnote-710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> before receiving the summons, lightly sever the thread
of their own existence by cutting their throats, hanging, poisoning,
or drowning themselves:&mdash;then such suicides, if the deed was not
done out of loyalty, filial piety, chastity, or friendship, for which
they would go to Heaven, but in a trivial burst of rage, or fearing
the consequences of a crime which would not amount to death, or
in the hope of falsely injuring a fellow-creature&mdash;then such suicides,
when the last breath has left their bodies, shall be escorted to this
Court by the Spirits of the Threshold and of the Hearth. They
shall be placed in the Hunger and Thirst Section, and every day
from 7 till 11 o’clock they will resume their mortal coil, and suffer
again the pain and bitterness of death. After seventy days, or one
or two years as the case may be, they will be conducted back to
the scene of their suicide, but will not be permitted to taste the
funeral meats, or avail themselves of the usual offerings to the dead.
Bitterly will they repent, unable as they will be to render themselves
visible and frighten people,<a id="Anchor-711" title="Go to Footnote 711" href="#Footnote-711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> vainly striving to procure a
substitute.<a id="Anchor-712" title="Go to Footnote 712" href="#Footnote-712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> For when the substitute shall have been harmlessly
entrapped, the Spirits of the Threshold and Hearth will reconduct
the erring soul back to this Court, whence it will be sent on to the
Second Court, where its balance of good and evil will be struck,
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-366"><a id="Page_ii-366"></a></span>
and dreadful tortures applied, being finally passed on through the
various Courts to the utter misery of hell. Should any one have such
intention of suicide and thus threaten a fellow creature, even though
he does not commit the act but continues to live not without virtue,
yet shall it not be permitted in any way to remit his punishment.
Any soul which after suicide shall not remain invisible, but shall
frighten people to death, will be seized by black-faced long-tusked
devils and tortured in the various hells, to be finally thrust into the
great Gehenna, for ever to remain hung up in chains, and not permitted
to be born again.</p>

<p>Every Buddhist or Taoist priest who receives money for prayers
and liturgies, but skips over words and misses out sentences, on
arriving at this, the First Court, will be sent to the section for the
Completion of Prayer, and there in a small dark room he shall pick
out such passages as he has omitted, and make good the deficiency
as best he can, by the uncertain light of an infinitesimal wick burning
in a gallon of oil. Even good and virtuous priests must also
repair any omissions they may have (accidentally) made, and so
must every man or woman who in private devotion may have
omitted or wrongly repeated any part of the sacred writings from
over-earnestness, their attention not being properly fixed on the
actual words they repeat. The same applies to female priests. A
dispensation from Buddha to remit such punishment is put in force
on the first day of each month when the names are entered in the
register of the virtuous.</p>

<p>O ye dwellers upon earth, on the 1st day of the 2nd moon, fasting
turn to the north and make oath to abstain from evil and fix your
thoughts on good, that ye may escape hell! The precepts of
Buddha are circulated over the whole world to warn mankind to
believe and repent, that when the last hour comes their spirits
may be escorted by dark-robed boys to realms of bliss and happiness
in the west.</p>


<h3>THE SECOND COURT.</h3>

<p>His Infernal Majesty, Ch‘u Ching, reigns at the bottom of the
great Ocean. Away to the south, below the Wu-chiao rocks, he
has a vast hell, many leagues in extent, and subdivided into
sixteen wards, as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the first, nothing but black clouds and constant sand-storms.
In the second, mud and filth. In the third, <i xml:lang="fr">chevaux de frise</i>. In
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-367"><a id="Page_ii-367"></a></span>
the fourth, gnawing hunger. In the fifth, burning thirst. In the
sixth, blood and pus. In the seventh, the shades are plunged into
a brazen cauldron (of boiling water). In the eighth, the same
punishment is repeated many times. In the ninth, they are put
into iron clothes. In the tenth, they are stretched on a rack to
regulation length. In the eleventh, they are pecked by fowls. In
the twelfth, they have only rivers of lime to drink. In the
thirteenth, they are hacked to pieces. In the fourteenth, the
leaves of the trees are as sharp as sword-points. In the fifteenth
they are pursued by foxes and wolves. In the sixteenth, all is ice
and snow.</p>

<p>Those who lead astray young boys and girls, and then escape
punishment by cutting off their hair and entering the priesthood;<a id="Anchor-713" title="Go to Footnote 713" href="#Footnote-713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>
those who filch letters, pictures, books, etc. entrusted to their care,
and then pretend to have lost them; those who injure a fellow-creature’s
ear, eye, hand, foot, fingers, or toes; those who practise as
doctors without any knowledge of the medical art; those who will
not ransom grown-up slave-girls;<a id="Anchor-714" title="Go to Footnote 714" href="#Footnote-714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> those who, contracting marriage
for the sake of gain, falsely state their ages; or those who in cases
of betrothal, before actual marriage, find out that one of the contracting
parties is a bad character, and yet do not come forward to
say so, but inflict an irreparable wrong on the innocent one;&mdash;such
offenders, when their quota of crime has been cast up, their
youth or age and the consequences of their acts taken into consideration,
will be seized by horrid red-faced devils and thrust into
the great Hell, and thence despatched to the particular ward in
which they are to be tormented. When their time of suffering
there has expired, they will be moved into the Third Hall, there to
be tortured and passed on to Gehenna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="ii-368"><a id="Page_ii-368"></a></span>
O ye men and women of the world, take this book and warn all
sinners, or copy it out and circulate it for general information! If
you see people sick and ill, give medicine to heal them. If you
see people poor and hungry, feed them. If you see people in
difficulties, give money to save them. Repent your past errors,
and you will be allowed to cancel that evil by future good, so that
when the hour arrives you will pass at once into the Tenth Hall,
and thence return again to existence on earth.</p>

<p>Let such as love all creatures endowed with life, and do not
recklessly cut and slay, but teach their children not to harm
small animals and insects&mdash;let these, on the 1st of the 3rd moon,
register an oath not to take life, but to aid in preserving it. Thus
they will avoid passing through Purgatory, and will also enter at
once the Tenth Hall, to be born again in some happy state.</p>


<h3>THE THIRD COURT.</h3>

<p>His Infernal Majesty Sung Ti reigns at the bottom of the great
Ocean, away to the south-east, below the Wu-chiao rock, in the
Gehenna of Black Ropes. This Hall is many leagues wide, and is
subdivided into sixteen wards, as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the first everything is Salt; above, below, and all round, the
eye rests upon Salt alone. The shades feed upon it, and suffer
horrid torments in consequence. When the fit has passed away
they return to it once again, and suffer agonies more unutterable
than before. In the second, the erring shades are bound with
cords and carry heavily-weighted <i>cangues</i>. In the third, they are
perpetually pierced through the ribs. In the fourth, their faces
are scraped with iron and copper knives. In the fifth, their fat
is scraped away from their bodies. In the sixth, their hearts and
livers are squeezed with pincers. In the seventh, their eyes are
gouged. In the eighth, they are flayed. In the ninth, their feet
are cut off. In the tenth, their finger-nails and toe-nails are
pulled out. In the eleventh their blood is sucked. In the twelfth,
they are hung up head downwards. In the thirteenth, their
shoulder-bones are split. In the fourteenth, they are tormented
by insects and reptiles. In the fifteenth, they are beaten on the
thighs. In the sixteenth, their hearts are scratched.</p>

<p>Those who enjoy the light of day without reflecting on the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-369"><a id="Page_ii-369"></a></span>
Imperial bounty;<a id="Anchor-715" title="Go to Footnote 715" href="#Footnote-715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> officers of State who revel in large emoluments
without reciprocating their sovereign’s goodness; private individuals
who do not repay the debt of water and earth;<a id="Anchor-716" title="Go to Footnote 716" href="#Footnote-716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> wives and concubines
who slight their marital lords; those who fail in their duties
as acting sons,<a id="Anchor-717" title="Go to Footnote 717" href="#Footnote-717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> or such as reap what advantages there are and
then go off to their own homes; slaves who disregard their
masters; official underlings who are ungrateful to their superiors;
working partners who behave badly to the moneyed partner;
culprits who escape from prison or abscond from their place of
banishment; those who break their bail and get others into trouble;
and those infatuated ones who have long omitted to pray and repent&mdash;all
these, even though they have a set-off of good deeds,
must pass through the misery of every ward. Those who interfere
with another man’s Fêng-Shui; those who obstruct funeral obsequies
or the completion of graves; those who in digging come on a coffin
and do not immediately cover it up, but injure the bones; those
who steal or avoid paying up their quota of grain;<a id="Anchor-718" title="Go to Footnote 718" href="#Footnote-718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> those who lose
all record of the site of their family burying-place; those who
incite others to commit crimes; those who promote litigation; those
who write anonymous placards; those who repudiate a betrothal;
those who forge deeds and other documents; those who receive
payment of a debt without signing a receipt or giving up the I O U;
those who counterfeit signatures and seals; those who alter bills;
those who injure posterity in any way&mdash;all these, and similar
offenders, shall be punished according to the gravity of each offence.
Devils with big knives will seize the erring ones and thrust them
into the great Gehenna; besides which they shall expiate their sins
in the proper number of wards, and shall then be forwarded to the
Fourth Court where they shall be tortured and dismissed to the
general Gehenna.</p>

<p>O ye sons of men, on the 8th day of the 2nd moon, register an
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-370"><a id="Page_ii-370"></a></span>
oath that ye will do no evil. Thus you may escape the bitterness of
these hells.</p>


<h3>THE FOURTH COURT.</h3>

<p>The Lord of the Five Senses reigns at the bottom of the great
Ocean, away to the east below the Wu-chiao rock. His Court is
many leagues wide, and is subdivided into sixteen wards, as
<span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the first, the wicked shades are hung up and water is continually
poured over them. In the second, they are made to kneel
on chains and pieces of split bamboo. In the third, their hands are
scalded with boiling water. In the fourth, their hands swell and
stream with perspiration. In the fifth, their muscles are cut and
their bones pulled out. In the sixth, their shoulders are pricked
with a trident and the skin rubbed with a hard brush. In the
seventh, holes are bored into their flesh. In the eighth, they are
made to sit on spikes. In the ninth, they wear iron clothes. In
the tenth, they are placed under heavy pieces of wood, stone, earth,
or tiles. In the eleventh, their eyes are put out. In the twelfth,
their mouths are choked with dust. In the thirteenth, they are
perpetually dosed with nasty medicines. In the fourteenth, it is so
slippery they are always falling down. In the fifteenth, their
mouths are painfully pricked. In the sixteenth, their bodies are
buried under broken stones, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, the head alone being left out.</p>

<p>Those who cheat the customs and evade taxes; those who repudiate

these shall be punished according to the gravity of their offences,
and shall be thrust by the devils into the great Gehenna until their
time arrives for passing into the Fifth Court.</p>

<p>O ye children of this world, if on the 18th day of the 2nd moon
you register an oath to sin no more, then you may escape the
various wards of this Hall; and if to this book you add examples
of rewards and punishments following upon virtues and crimes, and
hand them down to posterity for the good of the human race, so
that all who read may repent them of their wickednesses&mdash;then
they will be without sin, and you not without merit!</p>


<h3>THE FIFTH COURT.</h3>

<p>His Infernal Majesty, Yen Lo,<a id="Anchor-725" title="Go to Footnote 725" href="#Footnote-725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> said,&mdash;“Our proper place is in
the First Court; but, pitying those who die by foul means, and
should be sent back to earth to have their wrongs redressed, we
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-372"><a id="Page_ii-372"></a></span>
have moved our judgment-seat to the great hell at the bottom of
the Ocean, away to the north-east below the Wu-chiao rock, and
have subdivided this hell into sixteen wards for the torment of
souls. All those shades who come before us have already suffered
long tortures in the previous four Courts, whence, if they are
hardened sinners, they are passed on after seven days to this Court,
where if again found to be utterly hardened, corruption will overtake
them by the fifth or seventh day. All shades cry out either
that they have left some vow unfulfilled, or that they wish to build
a temple or a bridge, make a road, clean out a river or well,
publish some book teaching people to be virtuous, that they have
not released their due number of lives, that they have filial duties
or funeral obsequies to perform, some act of kindness to repay, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> For these reasons they pray to be allowed to return once more
to the light of day, and are always ready to make oath that henceforth
they will lead most exemplary lives. We, hearing this, reply,&mdash;In
days gone by ye openly worked evil, but now that your boat
has reached the midstream, ye bethink yourselves of caulking the
leak. For although P‘u-sa in his great mercy decreed that there
should be a modification of torture, and that good works might be
set off against evil, the same being submitted to God and ratified by
Divine Decree, to be further published in the realms below and in
the Infernal City&mdash;yet we Judges of the Ten Courts have not yet
received one single virtuous man amongst us, who, coming in the
flesh, might carry this <cite>Divine Panorama</cite> back with him to the light
of day. Truly those who suffer in hell and on earth cannot complain,
and virtuous men are rare! But now ye have come to my
Court, having beheld your own wickedness in the mirror of sin.
No more&mdash;bull-headed, horse-faced devils, away with them to the
Terrace<a id="Anchor-726" title="Go to Footnote 726" href="#Footnote-726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> that they may once more gaze upon their lost homes!”</p>

<p>This Terrace is curved in front like a bow; it looks east, west,
and south. It is eighty-one <i>li</i> from one extreme to the other. The
back part is like the string of the bow; it is enclosed by a wall of
sharp swords. It is 490 feet high; its sides are knife-blades; and
the whole is in sixty-three storeys. No good shade comes to this
Terrace; neither do those whose balance of good and evil is exact.
Wicked souls alone behold their homes close by and can see and
hear what is going on. They hear old and young talking together;
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-373"><a id="Page_ii-373"></a></span>
they see their last wishes disregarded and their instructions disobeyed.
Everything seems to have undergone a change. The
property they scraped together with so much trouble is dissipated
and gone. The husband thinks of taking another wife; the
widow meditates second nuptials.<a id="Anchor-727" title="Go to Footnote 727" href="#Footnote-727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Strangers are in possession of
the old estate; there is nothing to divide amongst the children.
Debts long since paid are brought again for settlement, and the
survivors are called upon to acknowledge claims upon the departed.
Debts owed are lost for want of evidence, with endless recriminations,
abuse, and general confusion, all of which falls upon the
three families<a id="Anchor-728" title="Go to Footnote 728" href="#Footnote-728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> of the deceased. They in their anger speak ill of
him that is gone. He sees his children become corrupt, and his
friends fall away. Some, perhaps, for the sake of bygone times,
may stroke the coffin and let fall a tear, departing quickly with a
cold smile. Worse than that, the wife sees her husband tortured
in the yamên; the husband sees his wife victim to some horrible
disease, lands gone, houses destroyed by flood or fire, and everything
in unutterable confusion&mdash;the reward of former sins.<a id="Anchor-729" title="Go to Footnote 729" href="#Footnote-729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> All
souls, after the misery of the Terrace, will be thrust into the great
Gehenna, and, when the amount of wickedness of each has been
ascertained, they will be passed through the sixteen wards for the
punishment of evil hearts. In the Gehenna they will be buried
under wooden pillars, bound with copper snakes, crushed by iron
dogs, tied tightly hand and foot, be ripped open and have their
hearts torn out, minced up and given to snakes, their entrails being
thrown to dogs. Then, when their time is up, the pain will cease
and their bodies become whole once more, preparatory to being
passed through the sixteen wards.</p>

<p>In the first are non-worshippers and sceptics. In the second,
those who have destroyed or hurt living creatures. In the third,
those who do not fulfil their vows. In the fourth, believers in false
doctrines, magicians, and sorcerers. In the fifth, those who
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-374"><a id="Page_ii-374"></a></span>
tyrannize over the weak but cringe to the strong; also those who
openly wish for another’s death. In the sixth, those who try to put
their misfortunes on to other people’s shoulders. In the seventh,
those who lead immoral lives. In the eighth, those who injure
others to benefit themselves. In the ninth, those who are parsimonious
and will not help people in trouble. In the tenth, those
who steal and involve the innocent. In the eleventh, those who
forget kindness or seek revenge. In the twelfth, those who by pernicious
drugs stir up others to quarrel, keeping themselves out of
harm’s way. In the thirteenth, those who deceive or spread false
reports. In the fourteenth, those who love brawling and implicate
others. In the fifteenth, those who envy the virtuous and wise.
In the sixteenth, those who are lost in vice, evil-speakers,
slanderers, and such like.</p>

<p>All who disbelieve the doctrine of Cause and Effect, who obstruct
good works, make a pretence of piety, talk of other people’s sins,
burn or injure religious books, omit to fast when praying for the
sick, interfere with the adoration of Buddha, slander the priesthood,
or, if scholars, abstain from instructing women and children;
those who dig up graves and obliterate all traces thereof, set light to
woods and forests, allow their servants to be careless in handling
fire and thus endanger their neighbours’ property; those who
wantonly discharge arrows and bolts, who try their strength against
the sick or weak, throw potsherds over a wall, poison fish, let off
guns, catch birds either with net, sticky pole,<a id="Anchor-730" title="Go to Footnote 730" href="#Footnote-730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> or trap; those who
throw down salt to kill plants, who do not bury dead cats and
venomous snakes deep in the ground, who dig out corpses, who
break the soil or alter their walls and stoves at wrong seasons,<a id="Anchor-731" title="Go to Footnote 731" href="#Footnote-731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>
who encroach on the public road or take possession of other
people’s land, who fill up wells and drains, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,&mdash;all these,
when they return from the Terrace, shall first be tortured in the
great Gehenna, and then such as are to have their hearts minced
shall be passed into the sixteen wards, thence to be sent on to the
Sixth Court for the punishment of other crimes. Those who in life
have not been guilty of the above sins, or, having sinned, did on
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-375"><a id="Page_ii-375"></a></span>
the 8th day of the 1st moon, fasting, register a vow to sin no more,
shall not only escape the punishments of this Court, but shall also
gain some further remission of torture in the Sixth Court. Those,
however, who are guilty of taking life, of gross immorality, of
stealing and implicating the innocent, of ingratitude and revenge,
of infatuated vice which no warnings can turn from its course,&mdash;these
shall not escape one jot of their punishments.</p>


<h3>THE SIXTH COURT.</h3>

<p>This Court is situated at the bottom of the great Ocean, due
north of the Wu-chiao rock. It is a vast, noisy Gehenna, many
leagues in extent, and around it are sixteen wards.</p>

<p>In the first, the souls are made to kneel for long periods on iron
shot. In the second, they are placed up to their necks in filth. In
the third, they are pounded till the blood runs out. In the fourth,
their mouths are opened with iron pincers and filled full of needles.
In the fifth, they are bitten by rats. In the sixth, they are
enclosed in a net of thorns and nipped by locusts. In the seventh,
they are crushed to a jelly. In the eighth, their skin is lacerated
and they are beaten on the raw. In the ninth, their mouths are
filled with fire. In the tenth, they are licked by flames. In the
eleventh, they are subjected to noisome smells. In the twelfth,
they are butted by oxen and trampled on by horses. In the
thirteenth, their hearts are scratched. In the fourteenth, their
heads are rubbed till their skulls come off. In the fifteenth, they
are chopped in two at the waist. In the sixteenth, their skin is
taken off and rolled up into spills.</p>

<p>Those discontented ones who rail against Heaven and revile
Earth, who are always finding fault either with the wind, thunder,
heat, cold, fine weather or rain; those who let their tears fall
towards the north;<a id="Anchor-732" title="Go to Footnote 732" href="#Footnote-732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> who steal the gold from the inside<a id="Anchor-733" title="Go to Footnote 733" href="#Footnote-733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> or scrape
the gilding from the outside of images; those who take holy names
in vain, who shew no respect for written paper, who throw down
dirt and rubbish near pagodas or temples, who use dirty cook-houses
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-376"><a id="Page_ii-376"></a></span>
and stoves for preparing the sacrificial meats, who do not
abstain from eating beef and dog-flesh;<a id="Anchor-734" title="Go to Footnote 734" href="#Footnote-734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> those who have in their
possession blasphemous or obscene books and do not destroy them,
who obliterate or tear books which teach man to be good, who
carve on common articles of household use the symbol of the origin
of all things,<a id="Anchor-735" title="Go to Footnote 735" href="#Footnote-735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> the Sun and Moon and Seven Stars, the Royal
Mother and the God of Longevity on the same article,<a id="Anchor-736" title="Go to Footnote 736" href="#Footnote-736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> or representations
of any of the Immortals; those who embroider the
Svastika<a id="Anchor-737" title="Go to Footnote 737" href="#Footnote-737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> on fancy work, or mark characters on silk, satin, or
cloth, on banners, beds, chairs, tables, or any kind of utensil; those
who secretly wear clothes adorned with the dragon and the
phœnix<a id="Anchor-738" title="Go to Footnote 738" href="#Footnote-738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> only to be trampled under foot, who buy up grain and
hold until the price is exorbitantly high&mdash;all these shall be thrust
into the great and noisy Gehenna, there to be examined as to their
misdeeds and passed accordingly into one of the sixteen wards,
whence, at the expiration of their time, they will be sent for further
questioning on to the Seventh Court.</p>

<p>All dwellers upon earth who on the 8th day of the 3rd moon,
fasting, register a vow from that date to sin no more, and, on the
14th and 15th of the 5th moon, the 3rd of the 8th moon, and the
10th of the 10th moon, to practise abstinence, vowing moreover to
exert themselves to convert others,&mdash;these shall escape the bitterness
of all the above-mentioned wards.</p>


<h3>THE SEVENTH COURT.</h3>

<p>His Infernal Majesty, T‘ai Shan, reigns at the bottom of the
great Ocean, away to the north-west, below the Wu-chiao rock.
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-377"><a id="Page_ii-377"></a></span>
His is a vast, noisy Court, measuring many leagues in circumference
and subdivided into sixteen wards, as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the first, the wicked souls are made to swallow their own
blood. In the second, their legs are pierced and thrust into a fiery
pit. In the third, their chests are cut open. In the fourth, their
hair is torn out with iron combs. In the fifth, they are gnawed by
dogs. In the sixth, great stones are placed on their heads. In the
seventh, their skulls are pierced. In the eighth, they wear fiery
clothes. In the ninth, their skin is torn and pulled by pigs. In
the tenth, they are pecked by huge birds. In the eleventh, they
are hung up and beaten on the feet. In the twelfth, their tongues
are pulled out and their jaws bored. In the thirteenth, they are
disembowelled. In the fourteenth, they are trampled on by mules
and bitten by badgers. In the fifteenth, their fingers are ironed
with hot irons. In the sixteenth, they are boiled in oil.</p>

<p>All mortals who practise eating red lead<a id="Anchor-739" title="Go to Footnote 739" href="#Footnote-739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> and certain other
nauseous articles,<a id="Anchor-740" title="Go to Footnote 740" href="#Footnote-740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> who spend more than they should upon wine,
who kidnap human beings for sale, who steal clothes and ornaments
from coffins, who break up dead men’s bones for medicine, who
separate people from their relatives, who sell the girl brought up in
the house to be their son’s wife, who allow their wives<a id="Anchor-741" title="Go to Footnote 741" href="#Footnote-741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> to drown
female children, who stifle their illegitimate offspring, who unite to
cheat another in gambling, who act as tutors without being properly
strict, and thus wrong their pupils, who beat and injure their slaves
without estimating the punishment by the fault, who regard
districts entrusted to their charge in the light of so much spoil, who
disobey their elders, who talk at random and go back on their
word, who stir up others to quarrel and fight&mdash;all these shall, upon
verification of their sins, be taken from the great Gehenna and
passed through the proper wards, to be forwarded when their time
has expired to the Eighth Court, again to be tortured according to
their deserts.</p>

<p>All things may not be used as drugs. It is bad enough to slay
birds, beasts, reptiles, and fishes, in order to prepare medicine
for the sick; but to use red lead and many of the filthy messes in
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-378"><a id="Page_ii-378"></a></span>
vogue is beyond all bounds of decency, and those who foul their
mouths with these nasty mixtures, no matter how virtuous they may
otherwise be, will not only derive no benefit from saying their
prayers, but will be punished for so doing without mercy.</p>

<p>Ye who hear these words make haste to repent! From to-day
forbear to take life, buy many birds and animals in order to set
them free,<a id="Anchor-742" title="Go to Footnote 742" href="#Footnote-742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> and every morning when you wash your teeth mutter a
prayer to Buddha. Thus, when your last hour comes, a good angel
will stand by your side and purify you of your former sins.</p>

<p>Some steal the bones of people who have been burnt to death or
the bodies of illegitimate children, for the purpose of compounding
medicines; others steal skulls and bones (from graves) with the
same object. Worst of all are those who carry off bones by the
basketful, using the hard ones for making various articles and
grinding down the soft ones for the manufacture of pottery.<a id="Anchor-743" title="Go to Footnote 743" href="#Footnote-743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>
These, no matter what may have been their good works on earth,
will not obtain thereby any remission of punishment; but when
they are brought down below, the Ruler of the Infernal Regions
will first pass them from the great Gehenna into the proper wards,
and will send instructions to the Tenth Court that when they are
born again on earth it shall be either without ears, or eyes, hand,
foot, mouth, lips, or nose, or maimed in some way or other. Yet
such as have thus sinned may still avoid this punishment, if only
they are willing to pray and repent, vowing never to sin again. Or
if they buy coffins for the poor and persuade others to do likewise,
by these means giving a decent burial to many corpses&mdash;then, when
the death-summons comes, the Spirits of the Home and Hearth
will make a black mark upon the warrant, and punishment will be
remitted.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when there is a famine, people have nothing to eat
and die of hunger, and wicked men, almost before the breath is
out of their bodies, cut them up and sell their flesh to others for
food&mdash;a horrid crime indeed. Those who are guilty of such practices
will, on arrival in the lower regions, be tortured in the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-379"><a id="Page_ii-379"></a></span>
various Courts for the space of forty-nine<a id="Anchor-744" title="Go to Footnote 744" href="#Footnote-744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> days, and then the
judge of the Tenth Court will be instructed to notify the judge
of the First Court to put them down in his register for a
new birth,&mdash;if among men, as hungry famished outcasts, and if
among animals as loathing the food that falls to their lot, and
by-and-by perishing of hunger. Such is their reward. Besides the
above, those who have eaten what is unfit for food and willingly
continue to do so, will be punished either among men or animals
according to their deserts. Their throats will swell, and though
devoured by hunger they will be unable to swallow, and thus die.
Those who do not err a second time may be forgiven as they deserve;
but those who in times of distress subscribe money for the
sufferers, prepare gruel, give away rice to the needy, or distribute
ginger tea<a id="Anchor-745" title="Go to Footnote 745" href="#Footnote-745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> and soup in the open street, and thus sustain life a
little longer and do real good to their fellow creatures&mdash;all these
shall not only obtain remission of their sins, but carry on a balance
of good to their account which shall ensure them a happy old age in
the life to come.<a id="Anchor-746" title="Go to Footnote 746" href="#Footnote-746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></p>

<p>Of the above three clauses, two were proposed by the officials
attached to this Seventh Court, the third by the Chief Justice of the
great Gehenna, and the whole submitted together for the approval
of God, the following Rescript being obtained:&mdash;“Let it be as
proposed; let the three clauses be copied into the <cite>Divine
Panorama</cite>, and let the officials concerned be promoted or rewarded.
Also, in case of crimes other than those already provided
for, let such be punished according to the statutes of the
Rulers of the Four Continents on earth, and let any evasion of
punishment and implication of innocent people be at once reported
by the proper officials for our consideration. This from the Throne!
Obey!”</p>

<p>O ye sons and daughters of men, if on the 27th of the 3rd moon,
fasting and turned towards the north, ye register a vow to pray and
repent, and to publish the whole of the <cite>Divine Panorama</cite> for the
enlightenment of mankind, then ye may escape the bitterness of
this Seventh Court.</p>


<p class="pagenum-h3-p"><span class="pagenum" title="ii-380"><a id="Page_ii-380"></a></span></p>

<h3>THE EIGHTH COURT.</h3>

<p>His Infernal Majesty, Tu Shih, reigns at the bottom of the
great Ocean, due east below the Wu-chiao rock, in a vast noisy
Court many leagues in extent, subdivided into sixteen wards as
<span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the first, the wicked souls are rolled down mountains in carts.
In the second, they are shut up in huge saucepans. In the third,
they are minced. In the fourth, their noses, eyes, mouths, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> are
stopped up. In the fifth, their uvulas are cut off. In the sixth,
they are exposed to all kinds of filth. In the seventh, their extremities
are cut off. In the eighth, their viscera<a id="Anchor-747" title="Go to Footnote 747" href="#Footnote-747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> are fried. In
the ninth, their marrow is cauterized. In the tenth, their bowels
are scratched. In the eleventh, they are inwardly burned with fire.
In the twelfth, they are disembowelled. In the thirteenth, their
chests are torn open. In the fourteenth, their skulls are split and
their teeth dragged out. In the fifteenth, they are hacked and
gashed. In the sixteenth, they are pricked with steel prongs.</p>

<p>Those who are unfilial, who do not nourish their relatives while
alive or bury them when dead, who subject their parents to fright,
sorrow, or anxiety&mdash;if they do not quickly repent them of their
former sins, the spirit of the Hearth will report their misdoings and
gradually deprive them of what prosperity they may be enjoying.
Those who indulge in magic and sorcery will, after death, when
they have been tortured in the other Courts, be brought here to
this Court, and dragged backwards by bull-headed horse-faced
devils to be thrust into the great Gehenna. Then when they have
been tortured in the various wards they will be passed on to the
Tenth Court, whence at the expiration of a <i>kalpa</i><a id="Anchor-748" title="Go to Footnote 748" href="#Footnote-748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> they will be sent
back to earth with changed heads and faces for ever to find their
place amongst the brute creation. But those who believe in the
<cite>Divine Panorama</cite>, and on the 1st of the 4th moon make a vow of
repentance, repeating the same every night and morning to the
Spirit of the Hearth, shall, by virtue of one of three characters,
<em>obedient</em>, <em>acquiescent</em>, or <em>repentant</em>, to be traced on their foreheads at
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-381"><a id="Page_ii-381"></a></span>
death by the Spirit of the Hearth, escape half the punishments
from the first to the Seventh Court inclusive, and escape this Eighth
Court altogether, being passed on to the Ninth Court, where cases
of arson and poisoning are investigated, and finally born again from
the Tenth Court among mankind as before.</p>

<p>To this God added, “Whosoever may circulate the <cite>Divine
Panorama</cite> for the information of the world at large shall escape
all punishment from the First to the Eighth Court inclusive. Passing
through the Ninth and Tenth Courts, they shall be born again
amongst men in some happy state.”</p>


<h3>THE NINTH COURT.</h3>

<p>His Infernal Majesty, P‘ing Têng, reigns at the bottom of the
great Ocean, away to the south-west, below the Wu-chiao rock.
His is the vast, circular hell of A-pi, many leagues in breadth,
jealously enclosed by an iron net, and subdivided into sixteen wards,
as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the first, the wicked souls have their bones beaten and their
bodies scorched. In the second, their muscles are drawn out and
their bones rapped. In the third, ducks eat their heart and liver.
In the fourth, dogs eat their intestines and lungs. In the fifth, they
are splashed with hot oil. In the sixth, their heads are crushed in
a frame, and their tongues and teeth are drawn out. In the
seventh, their brains are taken out and their skulls filled with
hedge-hogs. In the eighth, their heads are steamed and their brains
scraped. In the ninth, they are dragged about by sheep till they
drop to pieces. In the tenth, they are squeezed in a wooden press
and pricked on the head. In the eleventh, their hearts are ground
in a mill. In the twelfth, boiling water drips on to their bodies.
In the thirteenth, they are stung by wasps. In the fourteenth, they
are tortured by ants and maggots; they are then stewed, and finally
wrung out (like clothes). In the fifteenth, they are stung by
scorpions. In the sixteenth, they are tortured by venomous snakes,
crimson and scarlet.</p>

<p>All who on earth have committed one of the ten great crimes,
and have deserved either the lingering death, decapitation, strangulation,
or other punishment, shall, after passing through the
tortures of the previous Courts, be brought to this Court, together
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-382"><a id="Page_ii-382"></a></span>
with those guilty of arson, of making <i>ku</i> poison,<a id="Anchor-749" title="Go to Footnote 749" href="#Footnote-749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> bad books,
stupefying drugs, and many other disgraceful acts. Then, if it be
found that, hearkening to the words of the <cite>Divine Panorama</cite>, they
subsequently destroyed the blocks of these books, burnt their
prescriptions, and ceased practising the magical art, they shall
escape the punishments of this Court and be passed on to the Tenth
Court, thence to be born again amongst the sons of men. But if,
having heard the warnings of the <cite>Divine Panorama</cite>, they still
continue to sin, from the Second to the Eighth Court their tortures
shall be increased. They shall be bound on to a hollow copper
pillar, clasping it round with their hands and feet. Then the pillar
shall be filled with fierce fire, so as to burn into their heart and
liver; and afterwards their feet shall be plunged into the great
Gehenna of A-pi, knives shall be thrust into their lungs, they shall
bite their own hearts, and gradually sink to the uttermost depths of
hell, there to endure excruciating torments until the victims of their
wickedness have either recovered the property out of which they
were cheated, or the life that was taken away from them, and until
every trace of book, prescription, picture, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> formerly used by
these wicked souls has disappeared from the face of the earth.
Then, and only then, may they pass into the Tenth Court to be born
again in one of the Six States of existence.</p>

<p>O ye who have committed such crimes as these, on the 8th of the
4th moon, or the 1st or 15th (of any moon), fasting swear that you
will buy up all bad books and magical pamphlets and utterly destroy
them with fire; or that you will circulate copies of the <cite>Divine
Panorama</cite> to be a warning to others! Then, when your last
moment is at hand, the Spirit of the Hearth will write on your
forehead the two words <em>He obeyed</em>, and from the Second up to the
Ninth Court your good deeds will be rewarded by a diminution of
such punishments as you have incurred. People in the higher ranks
of life who secure incendiaries or murderers, who destroy the
blocks of bad books, or publish notices warning others, and offer
rewards for the production of such books, will be rewarded by the
success of their sons and grandsons at the public examinations.

Poor people who, by a great effort, manage to have the <cite>Divine
Panorama</cite> circulated for the benefit of mankind, will be forwarded
at once to the Tenth Court, and thence be born again in some happy
state on earth.</p>


<h3>THE TENTH COURT.</h3>

<p>His Infernal Majesty, Chuan Lun,<a id="Anchor-750" title="Go to Footnote 750" href="#Footnote-750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> reigns in the Dark Land,
due east, away below the Wu-chiao rock, just opposite the Wu-cho
of this world. There he has six bridges, of gold, silver, jade,
stone, wood, and planks, over which all souls must pass. He
examines the shades that are sent from the other courts, and,
according to their deserts, sends them back to earth as men,
women, old, young, high, low, rich, or poor, forwarding monthly a
list of their names to the judge of the First Court for transmission
to Fêng-tu.<a id="Anchor-751" title="Go to Footnote 751" href="#Footnote-751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a></p>

<p>The regulations provide that all beasts, birds, fishes, and insects,
whether biped, quadruped, or otherwise, shall after death become
<i>chien</i>,<a id="Anchor-752" title="Go to Footnote 752" href="#Footnote-752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> to be born again for long and short lives alternately. But
such as may possibly have taken life, and such as must necessarily
have taken life, will pass through a revolution of the Wheel, and
then, when their sins have been examined, they will be sent up on
earth to receive the proper retribution. At the end of every year a
report will be forwarded to Fêng-tu.</p>

<p>Those scholars who study the Book of Changes, or priests who
chant their liturgies, cannot be tortured in the Ten Courts for the
sins they have committed. When they come to this Court their
names and features are taken down in a book kept for the purpose,
and they are forwarded to Mother Mêng, who drives them on to the
Terrace of Oblivion and doses them with the draught of forgetfulness.
Then they are born again in the world for a day, a week, or
it may be a year, when they die once more; and now, having forgotten
the holy words of the Three Religions,<a id="Anchor-753" title="Go to Footnote 753" href="#Footnote-753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> they are carried off
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-384"><a id="Page_ii-384"></a></span>
by devils to the various Courts, and are properly punished for their
former crimes.</p>

<p>All souls whose balance of good and evil is exact, whose period,
or whose crimes are many and good deeds few, as soon as their
future state has been decided,&mdash;man, woman, beautiful, ugly, comfort,
toil, wealth, or poverty, as the case may be,&mdash;must pass
through the Terrace of Oblivion.</p>

<p>Amongst those shades, on their way to be born again in the world
of human beings, there are often to be found women who cry out
that they have some old and bitter wrong to avenge,<a id="Anchor-754" title="Go to Footnote 754" href="#Footnote-754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> and that
rather than be born again amongst men they would prefer to enter
the ranks of hungry devils.<a id="Anchor-755" title="Go to Footnote 755" href="#Footnote-755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> On examining them more closely it
generally comes out that they are the virtuous victims of some
wicked student, who may perhaps have an eye to their money, and
accordingly dresses himself out to entrap them, or promises marriage
when sometimes he has a wife already, or offers to take care of an
aged mother or a late husband’s children. Thus the foolish women
are beguiled, and put their property in the wicked man’s hands.
By-and-by he turns round upon and reviles them, and, losing face
in the eyes of their relatives and friends, with no one to redress
their wrong, they are driven to commit suicide. Then, hearing<a id="Anchor-756" title="Go to Footnote 756" href="#Footnote-756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>
that their seducer is likely to succeed at the examination, they beg
and implore to be allowed to go back and compass his death.
Now, although what they urge is true enough, yet that man’s
destiny may not be worked out, or the transmitted effects of his
ancestors’ virtue may not have passed away;<a id="Anchor-757" title="Go to Footnote 757" href="#Footnote-757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> therefore, as a
compromise, these injured shades are allowed to send a spirit to the
Examination Hall to hinder and confuse him in the preparation of
his paper, or to change the names on the published list of successful
candidates; and finally, when his hour arrives, to proceed with the
spirit who carries the death-summons, seize him, and bring him to
the First Court of judgment.</p>

<p>Ye who on the 17th of the 4th moon swear to carry out the precepts
of the <cite>Divine Panorama</cite>, and frequently make these words the
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-385"><a id="Page_ii-385"></a></span>
subject of your conversation, may in the life to come be born again
amongst men and escape official punishments, fire, flood, and all
accidents to the body.</p>

<p>The place where the Wheel of Fate goes round is many leagues
in extent, enclosed on all sides by an iron palisade. Within are
eighty-one subdivisions, each of which has its proper officers and
magisterial appointments. Beyond the palisade there is a labyrinth
of 108,000 paths leading by direct and circuitous routes back to
earth. Inside it is as dark as pitch, and through it pass the spirits
of priest and layman alike. But to one who looks from the outside
everything is seen as clear as crystal, and the attendants who guard
the place all have the faces and features they had at their birth.
These attendants are chosen from virtuous people who in life were
noted for filial piety, friendship, or respect for life, and are sent here
to look after the working of the Wheel and such duties. If for a
space of five years they make no mistakes they are promoted to a
higher office; but if found to be lazy or careless they are reported
to the Throne for punishment.</p>

<p>Those who in life have been unfilial or have destroyed much life,
when they have been tortured in the various Courts are brought
here and beaten to death with peach twigs. They then become
<i>chien</i>, and with changed heads and altered faces are turned out
into the labyrinth to proceed by the path which ends in the brute
creation.</p>

<p>Birds, beasts, fishes and insects, may after many myriads of
<i>kalpas</i> again resume their original shapes; and if there are any
that during three existences do not destroy life, they may be born
amongst human beings as a reward, a record being made and their
names forwarded to the First Court for approval. But all shades
of men and women must proceed to the Terrace of Oblivion.</p>

<p>Mother Mêng was born in the Earlier Han Dynasty. In her
childhood she studied books of the Confucian school; when she
grew up she chanted the liturgies of Buddha. Of the past and
the future she had no care, but occupied herself in exhorting
mankind to desist from taking life and become vegetarians. At
eighty-one years of age her hair was white and her complexion like
a child’s. She lived and died a virgin, calling herself simply
Mêng; but men called her Mother Mêng. She retired to the
hills and lived as a <i xml:lang="fr">religieuse</i> until the Later Han. Then, because
certain evil-doers, relying on their knowledge of the past, used to
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-386"><a id="Page_ii-386"></a></span>
beguile women by pretending to have been their husbands in a
former life, God commissioned Mother Mêng to build the Terrace of
Oblivion, and appointed her as guardian, with devils to wait upon
her and execute her commands. It was arranged that all shades
who had been sentenced in the Ten Courts to return in various
conditions to earth should first be dosed by her with a decoction of
herbs, sweet, bitter, acrid, sour or salt. Thus they forgot everything
that has previously happened to them, and carry away with
them to earth some slight weaknesses such as the mouth watering at
the thought (of something nice), laughter inducing perspiration, fear
inducing tears, anger inducing sobs, or spitting from nervousness.
Good spirits who go back into the world will have their senses of
sight, hearing, smell, and taste very much increased in power, and
their physical strength and constitution generally will be much
bettered. But evil spirits will experience the exact contrary of this,
as a reward for previous sins and as a warning to others to pray and
repent.</p>

<p>The Terrace is situated in front of the Ten Courts, outside the
six bridges. It is square, measuring ten (Chinese) feet every way,
and surrounded by 108 small rooms. To the east there is a raised
path, one foot four inches in breadth, and in the rooms above-mentioned
are prepared cups of forgetfulness ready for the arrival of
the shades. Whether they swallow much or little it matters not; but
sometimes there are perverse devils who altogether refuse to drink.
Then beneath their feet sharp blades start up, and a copper tube
is forced down their throats, by which means they are compelled
to swallow some. When they have drunk, they are raised by the
attendants and escorted back by the same path. They are next
pushed on to the Bitter Bamboo floating bridge, with torrents of
rushing red water on either side. Half way across they perceive
written in large characters on a red cliff on the opposite side the
following <span class="nowrap">lines:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse_i-0-5">“To be a man is easy, but to act up to one’s responsibilities as such
     is hard.</div>
<div class="verse_i0">Yet to be a man once again is harder still.</div>
<br/>
<div class="verse_i0">For those who would be born again in some happy state there is no
     great difficulty;</div>
<div class="verse_i0">It is only necessary to keep mouth and heart in harmony.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">When the shades have read these words they try to jump on shore,
but are beaten back into the water by two huge devils. One has
on a black official hat and embroidered clothes; in his hand he
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-387"><a id="Page_ii-387"></a></span>
holds a paper pencil, and over his shoulder he carries a sharp
sword. Instruments of torture hang at his waist, fiercely he glares
out of his large round eyes and laughs a horrid laugh. His name is
<i>Short Life</i>. The other has a dirty face smeared with blood; he has
on a white coat, an abacus in his hand and a rice sack over his
shoulder. Round his neck hangs a string of paper money; his
brow contracts hideously, and he utters long sighs. His name is
<i>They have their reward</i>, and his duty is to push the shades into
the red water. The wicked and foolish rejoice at the prospect of
being born once more as human beings; but the better shades weep
and mourn that in life they did not lay up a store of virtuous acts,
and thus pass away from the state of mortals for ever.<a id="Anchor-758" title="Go to Footnote 758" href="#Footnote-758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> Yet they
all rush on to birth like an infatuated or drunken crowd; and
again, in their early childhood, hanker after the forbidden flavours.<a id="Anchor-759" title="Go to Footnote 759" href="#Footnote-759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>
Then, regardless of consequences, they begin to destroy life, and
thus forfeit all claims to the mercy and compassion of God.
They take no thought as to the end that must overtake them;
and finally, they bring themselves once more to the same horrid
plight.</p>

<h3>ANCESTRAL WORSHIP.</h3>

<p>“The rudimentary form of all religion is the propitiation of dead
ancestors, who are supposed to be still existing, and to be capable
of working good or evil to their descendants.”&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Spencer’s Essays.</span>
<abbr title="Volume three">Vol. iii.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 102.&mdash;<cite>The Origin of Animal Worship.</cite></p>


<h3>BILOCATION.</h3>

<p>“As a general rule, people are apt to consider it impossible for a
man to be in two places at once, and indeed a saying to that effect
has become a popular saw. But the rule is so far from being
universally accepted, that the word ‘bilocation’ has been invented
to express the miraculous faculty possessed by certain saints of the
Roman Church, of being in two places at once; like St. Alfonso di
Liguori, who had the useful power of preaching his sermon in
church while he was confessing penitents at home.”&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Tylor’s</span>
<cite>Primitive Culture</cite>. <abbr title="Volume one">Vol. i.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 447.</p>


<h3>BURIAL RITES.</h3>

<p>“Hence the various burial rites&mdash;the placing of weapons and
valuables along with the body, the daily bringing of food to it, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
I hope hereafter, to show that with such knowledge of facts as he
has, this interpretation is the most reasonable the savage can
arrive at.”&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Spencer’s Essays.</span> <abbr title="Volume three">Vol. iii.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 104.&mdash;<cite>The Origin of
Animal Worship.</cite></p>


<h3>DREAMS.</h3>

<p>“The distinction so easily made by us between our life in dreams
and our real life, is one which the savage recognises in but a vague
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-390"><a id="Page_ii-390"></a></span>
way; and he cannot express even that distinction which he perceives.
When he awakes, and to those who have seen him lying
quietly asleep, describes where he has been, and what he has done,
his rude language fails to state the difference between seeing and
dreaming that he saw, doing and dreaming that he did. From this
inadequacy of his language it not only results that he cannot truly
represent this difference to others, but also that he cannot truly represent
it to himself.”&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Spencer’s Essays.</span> <abbr title="Volume three">Vol. iii.</abbr>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 103, 104.</p>


<h3>SHADE OR SHADOW.</h3>

<p>“The ghost or phantasm seen by the dreamer or the visionary is
an unsubstantial form, like a shadow, and thus the familiar term of
the <em>shade</em> comes in to express the soul. Thus the Tasmanian word
for the shadow is also that for the spirit; the Algonquin Indians
describe a man’s soul as <i>otahchuk</i>, ‘his shadow;’ the Quiché
language uses <i>natub</i> for ‘shadow, soul;’ the Arawac <i>ueja</i> means
‘shadow, soul, image;’ the Abipones made the one word <i>loákal</i>
serve for ‘shadow, soul, echo, image.’”&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Tylor’s</span> <cite>Primitive Culture</cite>.
<abbr title="Volume one">Vol. i.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 430.</p>


<h3>SHADOW.</h3>

<p>“Thus the dead in Purgatory knew that Dante was alive when
they saw that, unlike theirs, his figure cast a shadow on the
ground.”&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Tylor’s</span> <cite>Primitive Culture</cite>. <abbr title="Volume one">Vol. i.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 431.</p>


<h3>THE SOUL.</h3>

<p>“The savage, conceiving a corpse to be deserted by the active
personality who dwelt in it, conceives this active personality to be
still existing, and his feelings and ideas concerning it form the basis
of his superstitions.”&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Spencer’s Essays.</span> <abbr title="Volume three">Vol. iii.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 103.&mdash;<cite>The
Origin of Animal Worship.</cite></p>


<h3>TRANSMIGRATION.</h3>

<p>“Whether the Buddhists receive the full Hindu doctrine of the
migration of the individual soul from birth to birth, or whether they
refine away into metaphysical subtleties the notion of continued
personality, they do consistently and systematically hold that a
<span class="pagenum" title="ii-391"><a id="Page_ii-391"></a></span>
man’s life in former existences is the cause of his now being what he
is, while at this moment he is accumulating merit or demerit whose
result will determine his fate in future lives.”&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Tylor’s</span> <cite>Primitive
Culture</cite>. <abbr title="Volume two">Vol. ii.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 12.</p>


<h3>TRANSMIGRATION.</h3>

<p>“Memory, it is true, fails generally to recall these past births,
but memory, as we know, stops short of the beginning even of this
present life.”&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Tylor’s</span> <cite>Primitive Culture</cite>. <abbr title="Volume two">Vol. ii.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 12.</p>


<h3>TRANSMIGRATION.</h3>

<p>“As for believers, savage or civilised, in the great doctrine of
metempsychosis, these not only consider that an animal may have a
soul, but that this soul may have inhabited a human being, and thus
the creature may be in fact their own ancestor or once familiar
friend.”&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Tylor’s</span> <cite>Primitive Culture</cite>. <abbr title="Volume one">Vol. i.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 469.</p>


<h3>TREE-SOULS.</h3>

<p>“Orthodox Buddhism decided against the tree-souls, and consequently
against the scruple to harm them, declaring trees to have
no mind nor sentient principle, though admitting that certain dewas
or spirits do reside in the body of trees, and speak from within
them.”&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Tylor’s</span> <cite>Primitive Culture</cite>. <abbr title="Volume one">Vol. i.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 475.</p>

metaphysics, it is now but a shadow of its former self, and is
corrupted by the grossest forms of superstition borrowed from
Buddhism, which has in its turn adopted many of the forms and beliefs

<span class="label"><a id="Footnote-51" href="#Anchor-51" title="Back to Anchor 51">[51]</a></span> This form of sport may still be seen in the north of China. A
hare being started, two Chinese greyhounds (which are very slow) are
slipped from their leash in pursuit. But, as the hare would easily run
straight away from them, a falcon is released almost simultaneously.
The latter soars to a considerable height, and then swoops down on the
hare, striking it a violent blow with the “pounce,” or claw. This
partially stuns the hare, and allows the dogs to regain lost ground,
by which time the hare is ready once more, and off they go again. The
chase is ended by the hare getting to earth in a fox’s burrow, or
being ultimately overtaken by the dogs. In the latter case the heart
and liver are cut out on the spot, and given to the falcon; otherwise
he would hunt no more that day. Two falcons are often released, one
shortly after the other. They wear hoods, which are removed at the
moment of flying, and are attached by a slip-string from one leg to
the falconer’s wrist. During the night previous to a day’s hunting,
they are not allowed to sleep. Each falconer lies down with one falcon
on his left wrist, and keeps up an incessant tapping with the other on
the bird’s head. This is done to make them fierce. Should the quarry
escape, a hare’s skin is thrown down, by which means the falcons are
secured, and made ready for a further flight. Occasionally, but
rarely, the falcon misses its blow at the hare, with the result of a
broken or injured “arm.”<br/>

“The new Chinese ambassador in this country is a man of considerable
literary ability, and perhaps one of the few diplomatists since the
days of Matthew Prior (Lord Lytton alone excepted) who has achieved
distinction as a poet. Shortly after his arrival in this country, he
expressed a wish to become acquainted with the principal English
poets, and as Mr. Browning is more accessible and more a man of the
world than the Poet Laureate, an arrangement was made the other day by
which the two should be brought in contact with one another. After the
mutual courtesies, Mr. Browning having learnt that His Excellency was
also a poet, expressed a desire to know how much he had published.
“Only three or four volumes,” was the reply, through the interpreter.
“Then,” said Mr. Browning, “I am a greater offender than His
Excellency, and unequal to him in self-restraint. What kind of poetry
does His Excellency write: pastoral, humorous, epic or what?” There
was a pause for a short time. At length the interpreter said that His
Excellency thought his poetry would be better described as the
“enigmatic.” “Surely,” replied Mr. Browning, “there ought then to be
the deepest sympathy between us, for that is just the criticism which
is brought against my own works; and I believe it to be a just one.””<br/>

China. A large majority of the candidates who are unsuccessful at the
public examinations devote their energies in this direction; and in
every Chinese city there are regular establishments whither the
superstitious people repair to consult the oracle on every imaginable
subject; not to mention hosts of itinerant soothsayers, both in town
and country, whose stock-in-trade consists of a trestle-table, pen,
ink, and paper, and a few other mysterious implements of their art.
The nature of the response, favourable or otherwise, is determined by

During the year 1876 whole provinces were convulsed by the belief that
some such superstitious agency was at work to deprive innocent persons
of their tails; and the so-called “Pope” of the Taoist religion even
went so far as to publish a charm against the machinations of the
unseen. It ran as follows:&mdash;“Ye who urge filthy devils to spy out the
people!&mdash;the Master’s spirits are at hand and will soon discover you.
With this charm anyone may travel by sunlight, moonlight, or starlight
all over the earth.” At one time popular excitement ran so high that
serious consequences were anticipated; and the mandarins in the
affected districts found it quite as much as they could do to prevent
lynch-law being carried out on harmless strangers who were unlucky
enough to give rise to the slightest suspicion.

<span class="label"><a id="Footnote-82" href="#Anchor-82" title="Back to Anchor 82">[82]</a></span> The importance of male offspring in Chinese social life is hardly
to be expressed in words. To the son is confided the task of
worshipping at the ancestral tombs, the care of the ancestral tablets,
and the due performance of all rites and ceremonies connected with the
departed dead. No Chinaman will die, if he can help it, without
leaving a son behind him. If his wife is childless he will buy a
concubine; and we are told on page 41, <abbr title="volume thirteen">vol. xiii.</abbr>, of the <cite>Liao Chai</cite>,
that a good wife, “who at thirty years of age has not borne a child
should forthwith pawn her jewellery and purchase a concubine for her
husband; for to be without a son is hard indeed!” Another and a common
resource is to adopt a nephew; and sometimes a boy is bought from
starving parents, or from a professional kidnapper. Should a little
boy die, no matter how young, his parents do not permit even him to be
without the good offices of a son. They adopt some other child on his
behalf; and when the latter grows up it becomes his duty to perform
the proper ceremonies at his baby father’s tomb. Girls do not enjoy
the luxury of this sham posterity. They are quietly buried in a hole
near the family vault, and their disembodied spirits are left to
wander about in the realms below uncared for and unappeased. Every
mother, however, shares in the ancestral worship, and her name is
recorded on the tombstone, side by side with that of her husband.
Hence it is that Chinese tombstones are always to the memory either of
a father or of a mother, or of both, with occasionally the addition of
the grandfather and grandmother, and sometimes even that of the
generation preceding.<br/>

have originated about <span class="smallfont2">A.D.</span> 970, with Yao Niang, the concubine of the
pretender Li Yü, who wished to make her feet like the “new moon.” The
Manchu or Tartar ladies have not adopted this custom, and therefore
the empresses of modern times have feet of the natural size; neither
is it in force among the Hakkas or hill-tribes of China and Formosa.
The practice was forbidden in 1664 by the Manchu Emperor, K‘ang Hsi;
but popular feeling was so strong on the subject that four years
afterwards the prohibition was withdrawn. Protestant missionaries are
now making a dead set at this shameful custom, but so far with very
indifferent success; as parents who do not cramp the feet of their
daughters would experience no small difficulty in finding husbands for
them when they grow up. Besides, the gait of a young lady hobbling
along, as we should say, seems to be much admired by the other sex.
The following seven reasons why this custom still keeps its hold upon
the Chinese mind emanate from a native convert:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="footnote">
“1st.&mdash;If a girl’s feet are not bound, people say she is not like a
woman but like a man; they laugh at her, calling her names, and her
parents are ashamed of her.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
“2nd.&mdash;Girls are like flowers, like the willow. It is very important
that their feet should be bound short so that they can walk
beautifully, with mincing steps, swaying gracefully, thus showing they
are persons of respectability. People praise them. If not bound short,
they say the mother has not trained her daughter carefully. She goes
from house to house with noisy steps, and is called names. Therefore
careful persons bind short.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
“3rd.&mdash;One of a good family does not wish to marry a woman with long
feet. She is commiserated because her feet are not perfect. If
betrothed, and the size of her feet is not discovered till after
marriage, her husband and mother-in-law are displeased, her
sisters-in-law laugh at her, and she herself is sad.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
“4th.&mdash;The large footed has to do rough work, does not sit in a sedan
when she goes out, walks in the streets barefooted, has no red
clothes, does not eat the best food. She is wetted by the rain, tanned
by the sun, blown upon by the wind. If unwilling to do all the rough
work of the house she is called ‘gormandizing and lazy.’ Perhaps she
decides to go out as a servant. She has no fame and honour. To escape
all this her parents bind her feet.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
“5th.&mdash;There <em>are</em> those with unbound feet who do no heavy work, wear
gay clothing, ride in a sedan, call others to wait upon them. Although
so fine they are low and mean. If a girl’s feet are unbound, she
cannot be distinguished from one of these.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
“6th.&mdash;Girls are like gold, like gems. They ought to stay in their own
house. If their feet are not bound they go here and go there with
unfitting associates; they have no good name. They are like defective
gems that are rejected.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
“7th.&mdash;Parents are covetous. They think small feet are pleasing and
will command a high price for a bride.”&mdash;<cite>On Foot-Binding</cite>, by Miss S.
Woolston.<br/>

under certain conditions of time and good conduct, to appropriate to
themselves the vitality of some human being, who, as it were,
exchanges places with the so-called “devil.” The devil does not,
however, reappear as the mortal whose life it has become possessed of,
but is merely born again into the world; the idea being that the
amount of life on earth is a constant quantity, and cannot be
increased or diminished, reminding one in a way of the great modern
doctrine of the conservation of energy. This curious belief has an
important bearing that will be brought out in a subsequent story.<br/>

the Manchus were establishing their power, the dexterity of their
bowmen doubtless stood them in good stead; though if we are to judge

her maiden name. Children usually have a pet name given to them soon
after birth, which is dropped after a few years. Then there is the
<i>ming</i> or name, which once given is unchangeable, and by which the
various members of a family are distinguished. But only the father and
mother and certain other relatives are allowed to use this. Friends
call each other by their literary designations or “book-names,” which
are given generally by the teacher to whom the boy’s education is
first entrusted. Brothers and sisters and others have all kinds of
nick-names as with us. Dogs and cats are called by such names as

common shop-signs in every Chinese city; death and burial being
always, if possible, spoken of euphemistically in some such terms as
these. A dutiful son provides, when he can afford it, decent coffins
for his father and mother. They are generally stored in the house,
sometimes in a neighbouring temple; and the old people take pleasure
in seeing that their funeral obsequies are properly provided for,
though the subject is never raised in conversation. Chinese coffins
are beautifully made; and when the body has been in for a day or two,
a candle is closely applied to the seams all round to make sure it is
air-tight,&mdash;any crack, however fine, being easily detected by the
flickering of the flame in the escaping gas. Thus bodies may be kept
unburied for a long time, until the geomancer has selected an
auspicious site for the grave.<br/>

The period at which this cycle was invented is a subject upon which
complete uncertainty prevails, but there is little doubt that it first
came into use as a method of reckoning years after the reform of the

The birthday on which any person completes his cycle is considered a
very auspicious occasion. The second emperor of the present dynasty,
K‘ang Hsi, completed a cycle in his <em>reign</em>, with one year to spare;
and his grandson, Ch‘ien Lung (or Kien Lung) fell short of this only
by a single year, dying in the same cyclical period as that in which
he had ascended the throne.<br/>

We may here add that the value of male children to those who have no
heirs, and of female children to those who want servants, has fostered
a regular kidnapping trade, which is carried on with great activity in

<span class="label"><a id="Footnote-185" href="#Anchor-185" title="Back to Anchor 185">[185]</a></span> Slavery, under a modified form, exists in China at the present
day. All parents, having absolute power over their children, are at
liberty to sell them as servants or slaves to their wealthier
neighbours. This is not an infrequent occurrence in times of distress,
the children even going so far as to voluntarily sell themselves, and
exposing themselves in some public thoroughfare, with a notice affixed
to a kind of arrow on their backs, stating that they are for sale, and
the amount required from the purchaser. This I have seen with my own
eyes. The chief source, however, from which the supply of slaves is
kept up is kidnapping. [See <abbr title="Number Twenty-Three">No. XXIII.</abbr>, <a href="#Footnote-154">note 154</a>.] As to the condition
of the slaves themselves, it is by no means an unhappy one. Their
master has nominally the power of life and death over them, but no
Chinaman would ever dream of availing himself of this dangerous
prerogative. They are generally well fed, and fairly well clothed,
being rarely beaten, for fear they should run away, and either be lost
altogether or entail much expense to secure their capture. The girls
do not have their feet compressed; hence they are infinitely more
useful than small-footed women; and, on reaching a marriageable age,
their masters are bound to provide them with husbands. They live on
terms of easy familiarity with the whole household; and, ignorant of
the meaning and value of liberty, seem quite contented with a lot
which places them beyond the reach of hunger and cold. Slaves take the
surnames of their masters, and the children of slaves are likewise
slaves. Manumission is not uncommon; and Chinese history furnishes
more than one example of a quondam slave attaining to the highest
offices of State.<br/>

“With the slayer of his father, a man may not live under the same
heaven;” and in the <cite>Family Sayings</cite> (<abbr title="Book Ten">Bk. X.</abbr> <i><abbr title="ab initio">ab init.</abbr></i>), a work which
professes, though on quite insufficient authority, to record a number
of the conversations and apophthegms of Confucius not given in the
<cite>Lun-yü</cite>, or Confucian Gospels, we find the following course laid down
for a man whose father has been murdered:&mdash;“He must sleep upon a grass
mat, with his shield for his pillow; he must decline to take office;
he must not live under the same heaven (with the murderer). When he
meets him in the court or in the market-place, he must not return for
a weapon, but engage him there and then;” being always careful, as the
commentator observes, to carry a weapon about with him. Sir John Davis
and Dr. Legge agree in stigmatizing this as “one of the objectionable
principles of Confucius.” It must, however, be admitted that (1) a
patched-up work which appeared as we have it now from two to three
centuries after Confucius’s death, and (2) a confessedly apocryphal
work such as the <cite>Family Sayings</cite>, are hardly sufficient grounds for
affixing to the fair fame of China’s great Sage the positive
inculcation of a dangerous principle of blood-vengeance like that I
have just quoted.<br/>

put to Mencius (Book <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>) as to whether a man might even pull his

indeed a general principle that a man should avoid touching a woman’s
hand, but that he who could not make an exception in such a case would
be no better than a wolf. Neither, according to the Chinese rule,
should men and women hang their clothes on the same rack, which

this is of rare occurrence, as the consequences are terrible to the

to the chamber of death, and in the injured victim’s hand they place a
broom. They then support the corpse round the room, making its dead
arm move the broom from side to side, and thus sweep away wealth,
happiness, and longevity, from the accursed place for ever.”<br/>

a part at a Chinese as at a western dinner-party. In China, however,
the most honoured guest sits at (what may be called) the head of the
table, the host at the foot. I say “what may be called,” as Chinese
dining-tables are almost invariably square, and position alone
determines which is the head and which the foot. They are usually made
to accommodate eight persons; hence the fancy name “eight-angel
table,” in allusion to the eight famous angels, or Immortals, of the
Taoist religion. (See <abbr title="Number Five">No. V.</abbr>, <a href="#Footnote-48">note 48</a>.) Occasionally, round tables are

capped the verse given; and the more so because he has introduced,

of the gun is guilty of homicide; but were the same gun lying on a
table, it would be regarded as the will of Heaven. Similarly, a man is
held responsible for any death caused by an animal belonging to him;
though in such cases the affair can usually be hushed up by a money
payment, no notice being taken of crimes in general unless at the
instigation of a prosecutor, at whose will the case may be
subsequently withdrawn. Where the circumstances are purely accidental,
the law admits of a money compensation.<br/>

mentioned that the honorary tablets conferred from time to time by His

widowed before the age of thirty, have remained in that state for a
period of thirty years. The meaning of this is obvious: temptations
are supposed to be fewer and less dangerous after thirty, which is the
equivalent of forty with us; and it is wholly improbable that thirty
years of virtuous life, at which period the widow would be at least
fifty, would be followed by any act that might cast a stain upon the

China; but the singular keenness of the mandarins, as a body, in
recognising the innocent and detecting the guilty,&mdash;that is, when
their own avaricious interests are not involved,&mdash;makes this
contingency so rare as to be almost unknown. A good instance came
under my own notice at Swatow in 1876. For years a Chinese servant had
been employed at the foreign Custom House to carry a certain sum of
money every week to the bank, and at length his honesty was above
suspicion. On the occasion to which I allude he had been sent as usual
with the bag of dollars, but after a short absence he rushed back with
a frightful gash on his right arm, evidently inflicted by a heavy
chopper, and laying the bone bare. The money was gone. He said he had
been invited into a tea-house by a couple of soldiers whom he could
point out; that they had tried to wrest the bag from him, and that at
length one of them seized a chopper and inflicted so severe a wound on
his arm, that in his agony he dropped the money, and the soldiers made
off with it. The latter were promptly arrested and confronted with
their accuser; but, with almost indecent haste, the police magistrate
dismissed the case against them, and declared that he believed the man
had made away with the money and inflicted the wound on himself. And
so it turned out to be, under overwhelming evidence. This servant of
proved fidelity had given way to a rash hope of making a little money
at the gaming-table; had hurried into one of these hells and lost
everything in three stakes; had wounded himself on the right arm (he
was a left-handed man), and had concocted the story of the soldiers,
all within the space of about twenty-five minutes. When he saw that he
was detected, he confessed everything, without having received a
single blow of the bamboo; but up to the moment of his confession the
foreign feeling against that police-magistrate was undeniably strong.<br/>

jealously guarded and honestly administered, it is the great system of
competitive examinations which has obtained in China now for many
centuries. And yet frauds do take place, in spite of the exceptionally
heavy penalties incurred upon detection. Friends are occasionally
smuggled through by the aid of marked essays; and dishonest candidates
avail themselves of “sleeve editions,” as they are called, of the
books in which they are to be examined. On the whole, the result is a
successful one. As a rule the best candidates pull through; while, in
exceptional cases, unquestionably good men are rejected. Of the latter
class, the author of this work is a most striking instance. Excelling
in literary attainments of the highest order, he failed more than once
to obtain his master’s degree, and finally threw up in disgust.
Thenceforward he became the enemy of the mandarinate; and how he has
lashed the corruption of his age may be read in such stories as <i><a href="#chapter-72">The
Wolf Dream</a></i>, and many others, while the policy that he himself would
have adopted, had he been fortunate enough to succeed, must remain for
ever a matter of doubt and speculation.<br/>

temple form a very serious item in the expense of restoration. Public
subscriptions are usually the means employed for raising sufficient
funds, the names of subscribers and amount given by each being
published in some conspicuous position. Occasionally devout
priests&mdash;black swans, indeed, in China&mdash;shut themselves up in boxes
studded with nails, one of which they pull out every time a certain
donation is given, and there they remain until every nail is
withdrawn. But after all it is difficult to say whether they endure
these trials so much for the faith’s sake as for the funds from which
they derive more of the luxuries of life, and the temporary notoriety
gained by thus coming before the public. A Chinese proverb says, “The
image-maker doesn’t worship Buddha. He knows too much about the idol;”
and the application of this saying may safely be extended to the
majority of Buddhist priests in China.<br/>

instance, an adopted son excludes all the daughters of the family. A
man is not allowed to marry a girl whom he has adopted until he shall
have given her away to be adopted in a family of a <em>different surname
from his own;</em> after which fictitious ceremony, his marriage with her
becomes legal (see <abbr title="Number Fifteen">No. XV.</abbr>, <a href="#Footnote-109">note 109</a>); for the child adopted takes the
same surname as that of the family into which he is adopted, and is so
far cut off from his own relations, that he would not venture even to
put on mourning for his real parents without first obtaining the
consent of those who had adopted him. A son or daughter may be sold,
but an adopted child may not; neither may the adopted child be given
away in adoption to any one else without the specific consent of his
real parents. The general object in adopting children is to leave some
one behind at death to look after the duties of ancestral worship. For
this boys are preferred; but the <cite>Fortunate Union</cite> gives an instance
in which these rites were very creditably performed by the heroine of

which an indigent nominee is enabled to defray the expenses of his
journey to the post to which he has been appointed, and other calls
upon his purse. These loans are generally provided by some “western”
merchant, which term is an ellipsis for a “Shansi” banker, Shansi
being literally “west of the mountains.” Some one accompanies the
newly-made official to his post, and holds his commission in pawn
until the amount is repaid; which settlement is easily effected by the
issue of some well-understood proclamation, calling, for instance,
upon the people to close all gambling-houses within a given period.
Immediately the owners of these hells forward presents of money to the
incoming official, the Shansi banker gets his principal with interest,
perhaps at the rate of 2 per cent. <em>per month</em>, the gambling-houses
carry on as usual, and everybody is perfectly satisfied.<br/>

precisely similar in sound and tone, though written differently, to
the above <i>chên;</i> and, as far as the ear alone is concerned, our
hero’s name might have been either <i>Sun Must-be-saved</i> or <i>Sun

something in the air. A dog was then brought forward, and, being
placed at the lower end of the chain, immediately ran up, and reaching
the other end immediately disappeared in the air. In the same manner a
hog, a panther, a lion, and a tiger were alternately sent up the
chain, and all equally disappeared at the upper end of it. At last
they took down the chain, and put it into a bag, no one ever
discerning in what way the different animals were made to vanish into
the air in the mysterious manner above described. This, I may venture
to affirm, was beyond measure strange and surprising.”</p>

<span class="label"><a id="Footnote-533" href="#Anchor-533" title="Back to Anchor 533">[533]</a></span> We have in this story the keynote to the notorious and
much-to-be-deprecated dislike of the Chinese people to assist in
saving the lives of drowning strangers. Some of our readers may,
perhaps, not be aware that the Government of Hong-Kong has found it
necessary to insert a clause on the junk-clearances issued in that
colony, by which the junkmen are bound to assist to the utmost in
saving life. The apparent apathy of the Chinese in this respect comes
before us, however, in quite a different light when coupled with the
superstition that disembodied spirits of persons who have met a
violent death may return to the world of mortals if only fortunate
enough to secure a substitute. For among the crowd of shades, anxious
all to revisit their “sweet sons,” may perchance be some dear relative
or friend of the man who stands calmly by while another is drowning;
and it may be that to assist the drowning stranger would be to take
the longed-for chance away from one’s own kith or kin. Therefore, the
superstition-ridden Chinaman turns away, often perhaps, as in the
story before us, with feelings of pity and remorse. And yet this
belief has not prevented the establishment, especially on the river
Yang-tsze, of institutions provided with life-boats, for the express
purpose of saving life in those dangerous waters; so true is it that
when the Chinese people wish to move <i xml:lang="fr">en masse</i> in any given
direction, the fragile barrier of superstition is trampled down and
scattered to the winds.<br/>

<span class="label"><a id="Footnote-547" href="#Anchor-547" title="Back to Anchor 547">[547]</a></span> Salt is a Government monopoly in China, and its sale is only
permitted to licensed dealers. It is a contraband article of commerce,
whether for import or export, to foreign nations trading with China.
In an account of a journey from Swatow to Canton in March-April, 1877,
I wrote:&mdash;“<i>Apropos</i> of salt, we came across a good-sized bunker of it
when stowing away our things in the space below the deck. The boatmen
could not resist the temptation of doing a little smuggling on the way
up.... At a secluded point in a bamboo-shaded bend of the river, they
ran the boat alongside the bank, and were instantly met by a number of
suspicious-looking gentlemen with baskets, who soon relieved them of
the smuggled salt and separated in different directions.” Thus do the
people of China seek to lighten the grievous pressure of this tax. A
curious custom exists in Canton. Certain blind old men and women are
allowed to hawk salt about the streets, and earn a scanty living from
the profits they are able to make.</p>

<p class="footnote">
It may interest some to know that in the cities of the north of China
<em>ice</em> and <em>coal</em> may only be retailed by licensed dealers, who retain
such authority on the condition of supplying the yamêns of the local
mandarins with these two necessaries, free of all charge.<br/>

<span class="label"><a id="Footnote-549" href="#Anchor-549" title="Back to Anchor 549">[549]</a></span> These words require some explanation. Ordinarily they would be
taken in the sense of casting <i>cash</i> of a base description; but they
might equally well signify the casting of iron articles of any kind,
and thereby hang some curious details. Iron foundries in China may
only be opened under license from the local officials, and the
articles there made, consisting chiefly of cooking utensils, may only
be sold within a given area, each district having its own particular
foundries from which alone the supplies of the neighbourhood may be
derived. Free trade in iron is much feared by the authorities, as
thereby pirates and rebels would be enabled to supply themselves with
arms. At the framing of the Treaty of Tientsin, with its accompanying
tariff and rules, iron was not specified among other prohibited
articles of commerce. Consequently, British merchants would appear to
have a full right to purchase iron in the interior and convey it to
any of the open ports under Transit-pass. But the Chinese officials
steadily refuse to acknowledge, or permit the exercise of, this right,
putting forward their own time-honoured custom with regard to iron,
and enumerating the disadvantages to China were such an innovation to
be brought about.<br/>

<span class="label"><a id="Footnote-556" href="#Anchor-556" title="Back to Anchor 556">[556]</a></span> Such is one of the most common causes of hostile demonstration
against Chinese Christians. The latter, acting under the orders of the
missionaries, frequently refuse to subscribe to the various local
celebrations and processions, the great annual festivities, and
ceremonies of all kinds, on the grounds that these are idolatrous and
forbidden by the Christian faith. Hence bad feeling, high words, blows,
and sometimes bloodshed. I say “frequently,” because I have discovered
several cases in which converts have quietly subscribed like other
people rather than risk an <i xml:lang="fr">émeute</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote">
An amusing incident came under my own special notice not very long
ago. A missionary appeared before me one day to complain that a
certain convert of his had been posted in his own village, and cut off
from his civic rights for two years, merely because he had agreed to
let a room of his house to be used as a missionary <i xml:lang="fr">dépôt</i>. I took a
copy of the placard which was handed to me in proof of this statement,
and found it to run thus:&mdash;“In consequence of <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span> having entered into
an agreement with a barbarian pastor, to lease to the said barbarian
pastor a room in his house to be used as a missionary chapel, we, the
elders of this village, do hereby debar <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span> from the privilege of
worshipping in our ancestral hall for the space of two years.” It is
needless, of course, to mention that Ancestral Worship is prohibited
by all sects of missionaries in China alike; or that, when I pointed
this out to the individual in question, who could not have understood
the import of the Chinese placard, the charge was promptly withdrawn.<br/>

smiles down upon the handsome decorations thus provided by devout and

<p class="footnote">
There is a cognate custom belonging to the ceremonies of ancestral
worship, of great importance in the eyes of the Chinese. On a certain
day after the death of a parent, the surviving head of the family
proceeds with much solemnity to dab a spot of ink upon the memorial
tablet of the deceased. This is believed to give to the departed
spirit the power of remaining near to, and watching over the fortunes
of, those left behind.<br/>

Chinese and foreigners, might be induced to follow my example. On my
declining to do so, the manager of the concern informed me that if I
would only put down my name for fifty dollars, say £10, no call should
be made upon me for the money! Even in the matter of the funds
collected for the famine-stricken people of 1878, it is whispered that
peculation has been rife.<br/>

composition of these stories, more than 200 years ago, and remains so
at the present day. The character <i>chi</i>, used here and elsewhere for
Planchette, is defined in the <cite>Shuo Wên</cite>, a Chinese dictionary,
published <span class="smallfont2">A.D.</span> 100, “to inquire by divination on doubtful topics,” no
mention being made of the particular manner in which responses are
obtained. For the purpose of writing from personal experience, I
recently attended a <i>séance</i> at a temple in Amoy, and witnessed the
whole performance. After much delay, I was requested to write on a
slip of paper “any question I might have to put to the God;” and,
accordingly, I took a pencil and wrote down, “A humble suppliant
ventures to inquire if he will win the Manila lottery.” This question
was then placed upon the altar, at the feet of the God; and shortly
afterwards two respectable-looking Chinamen, not priests, approached a
small table covered with sand, and each seized one arm of a forked
piece of wood, at the fork of which was a stumpy end, at right angles
to the plane of the arms. Immediately the attendants began burning
quantities of joss-paper, while the two performers whirled the
instrument round and round at a rapid rate, its vertical point being
all the time pressed down upon the table of sand. All of a sudden the
whirling movement stopped, and the point of the instrument rapidly
traced a character in the sand, which was at once identified by
several of the bystanders, and forthwith copied down by a clerk in
attendance. The whirling movement was then continued until a similar
pause was made and another character appeared; and so on, until I had
four lines of correctly-rhymed Chinese verse, each line consisting of
seven characters. The following is an almost word-for-word
<span class="nowrap">translation:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

legal punishment for many crimes not considered capital in the West;
and by the severe measures that are always taken in cases of
rebellion, when the innocent and guilty are often indiscriminately
massacred. In times of tranquillity, however, this is not the case;
and the execution of a criminal is surrounded by a number of
formalities which go far to prevent the shedding of innocent blood.
